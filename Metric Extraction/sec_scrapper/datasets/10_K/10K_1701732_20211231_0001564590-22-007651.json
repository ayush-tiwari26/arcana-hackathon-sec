We have been expanding our direct sales team including our inside sales operations aggressively to reach more customers and market verticals.\nOur direct sales force is responsible for developing new customers, ensuring high recurring rates from our existing customers, and expanding the use of Altair and partner products within customers\u2019 environments through continuous training, support, and consulting engagements. Each of our field sales professionals are supported by technical specialists with deep knowledge of our products and the broader product development domain. We believe this approach differentiates Altair from our competitors, as our focus on establishing a strong working relationship with the user community has led to expanded usage of Altair and APA partner products. Our direct sales force is organized by geographic regions, consisting of Americas, EMEA, and APAC.\nWe leverage indirect sales channels especially in APAC and Eastern Europe and have been investing to extend our reseller relationships in all markets. Approximately 12% of our 2021 software revenue was generated through our growing network of indirect channel partners and resellers.\nData Analytics, AI, IoT, and Smart Product Development\nThe data analytics and AI market is segmented by industry verticals where specific domain expertise is important for success. Altair\u2019s primary data analytics and AI customer base is banks, insurance companies, health care, and other financial services organizations along with finance departments across most industries including manufacturing. As we cross sell into Altair traditional manufacturing customer accounts, we are targeting both the finance departments, leveraging the expertise of our financial markets sales and technical teams, as well as engineering departments looking to apply data analytics and AI to improve designs, manufacturing, warranty, and in-service operations. We intend to leverage our existing direct and indirect sales channels in order to support greater market opportunities.\nHigh-Performance Computing Solutions\nAltair\u2019s HPC solutions are sold by our global strategic sales force with sales overlay support from Altair HPC sales specialists and application engineers. We have original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, arrangements for these solutions with most of the major hardware companies. We believe these arrangements reduce competition, grow our market share and improve sales efficiency.\nWe offer Altair PBS Professional as both an open source and a commercial solution. Commercial sites generally license the commercial version along with support. However, many universities, government agencies and small commercial sites prefer the open source version as their work often needs to be freely available for societal benefit. Large government and research installations generally still purchase support and often pay for specific development.\nLicensing\nThere are two licensing methods we employ to deliver our software solutions:\n\u2022\nMost products are available under our unique, patented units-based licensing model.\n\u2022\nA small subset of our products is available on a node-locked, or hardware specific, and named-user basis. This is especially true for our high-performance computing solutions.\nAltair pioneered a patented units-based subscription licensing model for software and other digital content. This units-based subscription licensing model allows flexible and shared access to our offerings, along with over 150 partner products. Our customers license a pool of units for their organizations giving individual users access to our portfolio of software applications as well as our growing portfolio of partner products. We believe our units-based subscription licensing model lowers barriers to adoption, creates broad engagement, encourages users to work within our ecosystem, and increases revenue. This, in turn, helps drive our recurring software license rate which has been on average approximately 90% over the past five years. Each year approximately 60% of new software revenue comes from expansion within existing customers.\nMarketing\nAltair\u2019s global marketing team of approximately 95 people is focused on generating new business opportunities by driving awareness, deepening customer engagement, and developing content specific to technical fields and industry verticals.

In 2021, we generated 38%, 30% and 32% of our total billings from customers in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, respectively. The usage of our solutions is much more balanced between Americas, EMEA, and APAC; the higher percentage in the Americas reflects a significantly higher number of global accounts billed in the United States than in other regions. Billings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions during the period, and is discussed under Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a summary of our financial information by geographic location, see Note 17 of Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.\nCompetition\nThe market for simulation, HPC, data analytics, and AI software is highly fragmented. Our primary competitors include companies such as IBM, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Siemens, Ansys, MSC Software (a Hexagon company), and Alteryx. Many are large public companies, with significant financial resources. In addition to these competitors, we compete with many smaller companies offering similar software applications.\nWe believe the breadth and depth of Altair\u2019s software offering is unique and no single competitor addresses our entire solution set. The units model further extends this advantage with a growing APA marketplace of third-party software.\nOur simulation solutions including modeling, visualization and solvers are noted in the market for their ability to handle large and complex models. Our software applications deliver high performance and high scalability, including massive parallelization, which is\nextremely important in the high-end simulation market. Altair is a leader in integrating optimization technology across all our products, including multi-disciplinary applications.\nWe believe our solutions for data preparation, data science and AI are extremely strong, easy to use, powerful, and broadly adopted and have several unique capabilities including handling large, complex data sets coupled with our ability to intelligently import unstructured data.\nTo ensure customer success and deepen our relationships with them, we engage with our customers to provide consulting, implementation services, training, and support, especially when applying optimization. We believe these services, combined with our ability to leverage HPC as the industry transitions to cloud computing, positions us for future success.\nWe compete on a variety of factors including the breadth, depth, performance, and quality of our technical solutions. We believe our patented units-based subscription licensing model provides us with a competitive advantage by lowering barriers to adoption, creating broad engagement, and encouraging users to work within our ecosystem.\nIntellectual property\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We actively protect our investment in technology through establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. The nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have 274 issued patents and more than 80 published patent applications worldwide. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Additionally, we are the registered holder of a variety of trademarks and domain names that include \u201cAltair\u201d and similar variations.\nNonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws and enforcement of the laws of various countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Our inability to assert or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we receive claims alleging infringement of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, including patents. Disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to, among other things, costly litigation, diversion of time, money and resources to develop or obtain non-infringing products, or delay product distribution. Any significant impairment of our core intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nOur products are licensed to users pursuant to signed license agreements or \u2018click through\u2019 agreements containing restrictions on use, duplication, disclosure, and transfer. Cloud based products and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing appropriate restrictions on access and use.\nWe are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists. We believe, however, that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results. We believe that our predominant subscription based business model combined with the change from desktop to cloud based computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated.\nIn addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed technology.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had more than 2,800 in-house employees and more than 250 on-site Client Engineering Services employees globally. More than two-thirds of our employees are located in the United States, India, France and Germany. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In some of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these councils. We have never\nexperienced a work stoppage and we believe our employee relations are good. We continually recruit for top talent and invest in our global workforce to fuel diversity, professional and personal growth, and innovation.\nDiversity\nWe believe that empowering each individual authentic voice encourages an entrepreneurial mindset. We have worked to create a culture of inclusion where diversity and experiences are embraced and essential to our success and long-term growth. We recognize and believe that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment. We believe that we comply in all material respects with all applicable U.S. Federal, state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. Our goal is to assure that all applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status.\nHuman capital metrics\nWe monitor human capital metrics such as recruitment, attrition, development, and diversity. Our strong brand, innovative product portfolio, cross-industry expertise, and culture support our ability to recruit and retain top talent.\nInformation technology and cybersecurity\nOur business and support functions utilize information systems that provide critical services to our employees and customers. Led by our Chief Information Security Officer, our team of professionals manage and support our communication platforms, transaction-management systems, and analytics and reporting capabilities. We use both third-party cloud services and off-site, secure data centers in North America and Europe for our core applications.\nInformation security and privacy are important concerns, with an escalating cyber-threat environment and evolving regulatory requirements driving continued investment in this area. We continue to evaluate and assess our systems in the changing regulatory environment.\nWe have in place, and seek to continuously improve, a comprehensive system of security controls, managed by a dedicated staff. Periodically, we engage the services of third parties to perform security penetration testing and may update our security controls in response. We also provide our staff with regular security risk awareness, education, and training. Despite these efforts computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct, and other internal or external hazards including natural disasters could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions.\nWe have incident response and business continuity plans for our operations. Our recovery plans include arrangements with our off-site secure data centers and cloud infrastructure. We believe we will be able to utilize these plans to efficiently recover key system functionality in the event that our primary systems are unavailable.\nCOVID-19\nAltair\u2019s culture has historically embraced flexible work arrangements. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2021, our workforce remained in a mode of nearly full remote working. Our culture, technology and people allowed us to react quickly when the crisis initially emerged. As a result, we maintained high levels of productivity and employee engagement. We adopted global and local COVID-19 safety protocols and guidelines to ensure the safety, health and wellness of our employees, families, and local communities. We also provide virtual health and wellness programs, such as meditation, mental health tips, and information sessions by medical professionals to educate and answer questions about COVID-19. Our executive staff, including the CEO, are highly engaged with our workforce through podcasts, town halls, and other methods of outreach enabled by the accelerated adoption of virtual communication platforms.\nSustainability and environment\nAs the world is demanding safer, more efficient and innovative products and processes, our vision is to help customers drive decisions leveraging the convergence of simulation, HPC, and AI. By helping our customers, we help to reduce the environmental impact of goods and services across a broad array of industries worldwide. Altair published a formal Sustainability report in November 2021.\nWe believe that our software technology and consulting services are by their very essence at the core of designing a healthier and more sustainable future for humanity. These efforts include:\n\u2022\nEnabling structural optimization to inspire and refine product designs that minimize material usage and maximize performance\n\u2022\nConducting HPC workload management to ensure efficiency of energy usage and run time\n\u2022\nUtilizing simulation- and AI-driven innovation to rapidly develop products, processes, and experiences in a virtual world without the carbon and waste stream impact of multiple physical prototypes\n\u2022\nSupporting additive manufacturing and other advanced manufacturing techniques to embody the most optimal designs developed from simulation methodologies at the lowest cost\n\u2022\nOffering cloud-based applications which allow efficiently scaled shared infrastructure to be used by multiple organizations, thus eliminating countless independent compute server installations, and giving access to a broad range of applications relevant to sustainable design\nWe also are committed to conducting our business in a manner that manages environmental issues responsibly. We fulfill this commitment by our efforts to:\n\u2022\nComply with local environmental regulations across all of our global offices\n\u2022\nConduct operations in an environmentally sound manner\n\u2022\nManage our supply chains toward appropriate environmental practices\nAcquisitions\nWe have acquired 43 companies or strategic technologies since 1996, including 24 in the last five years. These acquisitions brought strategic IP assets, and talented developers with expertise in disciplines ranging from electronics, material science, crash and safety to industrial design and rendering. Products which are commercially available as a result of these acquisitions include Altair PBS Works, Radioss, Evolve, Acusolve, SimLab, Embed, Multiscale Designer, FEKO, FLUX, Thea Render, SmartWorks, ESAComp, SimSolid, Monarch, Panopticon, EDEM, PollEx, PolyFoam, Grid Engine, Mistral, Breeze, S-FRAME, and WPS Analytics.\nOur 2021 acquisitions include the following:\n\u2022\nS-FRAME Software Inc.: In August 2021, the Company acquired S-FRAME Software Inc., a structural analysis software platform used by engineers to evaluate a structure\u2019s ability to withstand external loads (like wind, water, and snow) and meet design code requirements around the world.\n\u2022\nWorld Programming: In December 2021, we acquired World Programming Limited and December 2015 Software Limited (together \u201cWorld Programming\u201d). World Programming is an enterprise software company based in the UK and focused on data analytics for financial services, insurance, manufacturing, life sciences, energy, consumer products, and retail applications. World Programming\u2019s platform supports development and execution of multi-language software solutions leveraging popular languages used in data science including Python, R, and the SAS language in a single program.\nFor further information about our acquisitions, see Note 4 of the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonal variations\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers\u2019 purchases of our software and services. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which often coincide with the calendar year. These seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as license fees become due at the time the license term commences based upon agreed payment terms that customers may not adhere to. As a result, new and renewal licenses have been concentrated in the first and fourth quarter of the year, and our cash flows from operations have been highest late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter of the succeeding fiscal year.\nBacklog\nWe generally enter into single year term-based software licensing subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. As we generally enter into single year subscription contracts for our platform, backlog is not significant.\nGovernmental Regulation\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety and environmental laws, privacy and data protection laws, financial services laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. These laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus we must continue to monitor and dedicate resources to ensure continued compliance. We strive to maintain compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to anticipate future regulatory developments. For additional information, see \u201cRisk Factors - Risks related to legal or regulatory matters.\u201d\nSegments\nWe have identified two reportable segments: Software and Client Engineering Services. For additional information about our reportable segments, see Note 17 of the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.\nCorporate information\nWe were incorporated in Michigan in 1985 and became a Delaware company in October 2017.

and\n\u2022\nthe impact of operating and financial covenants in our loan agreements.\nGeneral risks, including risks relating to:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nany need we may have to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties associated with predicting our growth;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential changes in accounting principles.\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth and we may fail to sustain that growth rate or may not grow in the future.\nWe were founded in 1985 and launched our first commercial software in 1990. Our growth has primarily been attributed to the increasing sales of our simulation, high-performance computing and data analytics technologies to enhance decision making, product performance, compress development time, and reduce costs. Revenue from our software segment has historically constituted a significant portion of our total revenue. Our revenue growth could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition from smaller entities and well-established, larger organizations, limited ability to, or our decision not to, increase pricing, contraction of our overall market, the manner in which the markets for our products, including our data analytics products, evolve or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Other factors include managing our global organization, revenues generated outside the United States that are subject to adverse currency fluctuations, uncertain international geopolitical landscapes and the acquisition of businesses which may grow more slowly than our business. Accordingly, we may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods, and you should not rely on our historical revenue growth as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture of innovation, teamwork, and communication, our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success has been our company culture, which is based on our core values of innovation, envisioning the future, communicating honestly and broadly, seeking technology and business firsts, and embracing diversity. We have invested substantial time and resources in building a company embodying this culture. As we continue to develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture, or embed our culture in our acquired businesses, could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain personnel, encourage innovation and teamwork, and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIf our existing customers or users do not increase their usage of our software, or we do not add new customers, the growth of our business may be harmed.\nOur software includes a comprehensive open architecture solution for simulation, high-performance computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to increase the:\n\u2022\nnumber of customers and users accessing our software;\n\u2022\nusage of our software to address expanding design, engineering, AI, computing and analytical needs; and/or\n\u2022\nnumber of our applications and functionalities accessed by users and customers through our licensing model.\nOur future success may also depend upon the degree to which the evolution of our units licensing model is accepted by our current and potential customers.\nIn addition, through our Altair Partner Alliance, or APA, our customers have access to additional software offered by independent third parties, without the need to enter into additional license agreements.\nIf we fail to increase the number of customers or users and/or application usage among existing users of our software and the software of our APA partners, our ability to license additional software will be adversely affected, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to acquire new customers is difficult to predict because our software sales cycle can be long.\nOur ability to increase revenue and maintain or increase profitability depends, in part, on widespread acceptance of our software by mid- to- large-size organizations worldwide. We face long, costly, and unpredictable sales cycles. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete sales could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements, budget cycles and the specific software or products being purchased, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\nlongstanding use of competing products and hesitancy to change;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\ntiming of customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022\nneed by some customers for lengthy evaluations;\n\u2022\nhesitation to adopt new processes and technologies;\n\u2022\nlength and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes; and\n\u2022\ndevelopment of software by our competitors perceived to be equivalent or superior to our software.\nTo the extent any of the foregoing occur, our average sales cycle may increase and we may have difficulty acquiring new customers.\nReduced spending on product design and development activities by our customers may negatively affect our revenues.\nOur revenues are largely dependent on our customers\u2019 overall product design and development activities, particularly demand from mid- to- large-size organizations worldwide and their supplier base. The licensing of our software is discretionary. Our customers may reduce their research and development budgets, which could cause them to reduce, defer, or forego licensing of our software. To the extent licensing of our software is perceived by existing and potential customers to be extraneous to their needs, our revenue may be negatively affected by our customers\u2019 delays or reductions in product development research and development spending. Customers may delay or cancel software licensing or seek to lower their costs. Deterioration in the demand for product design and development software for any reason would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition in the future.\nOur business largely depends on annual renewals of our software licenses.\nWe typically license our software to our customers on an annual basis. In order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew and/or increase the amount of software licensed on an annual basis. Customer renewal rates may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour pricing or license term and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour reputation for performance and reliability;\n\u2022\nnew product releases by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our software or support;\n\u2022\nconsolidation within our customer base;\n\u2022\navailability of comparable software from our competitors;\n\u2022\neffects of global or industry specific economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 ability to continue their operations and spending levels; and\n\u2022\nother factors, a number of which are beyond our control.\nIf our customers fail to renew their licenses or renew on terms that are less beneficial to us, our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate, which may harm our business.\nWe believe our future success will depend, in part, on the growth in demand for our software by customers other than simulation engineering specialists and in additional industry verticals.\nHistorically, our customers have been simulation engineering specialists. To enable concept engineering, driven by simulation, we make our physics solvers more accessible to designers by wrapping them in powerful simple interfaces. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on growth in demand for our software by these designers, which could be negatively impacted by the lack of:\n\u2022\ncontinued and/or growing reliance on software to optimize and accelerate the design process;\n\u2022\nadoption of simulation technology by designers other than simulation engineering specialists;\n\u2022\ncontinued proliferation of mobility, large data sets, cloud computing and IoT;\n\u2022\nour ability to predict demands of designers other than simulation engineering specialists and achieve market acceptance of our software or products within these additional areas and customer bases or in additional industry verticals; or\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to changes in the competitive landscape, including whether our competitors establish more widely adopted products for designers other than simulation engineering specialists.\nIf some or all of this software does not achieve widespread adoption, our revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business may be adversely impacted by difficulties we may experience in integrating recent acquisitions or in integrating future acquisitions.\nWe believe that our recent acquisitions result in certain benefits, including expanding our portfolio of software and products and enabling us to better serve our customers\u2019 needs. However, to realize some of these anticipated benefits, the acquired businesses must be successfully integrated. The success of these acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage relationships with new or potential customers;\n\u2022\nfailure of existing customers to accept new service and product offerings from us;\n\u2022\nrevenue attrition in excess of anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of technologies and systems;\n\u2022\nfailure to leverage the increased scale of our business quickly and effectively;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of our enhanced portfolio of software and products;\n\u2022\nfailure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;\n\u2022\nfailure to convert an increasing amount of new or acquired customer relationships revenue from perpetual to annual recurring revenue streams; or\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively invest in further sales, marketing, and research and development efforts that lead to increased revenues.\nWe face significant competition, which may adversely affect our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers, and grow our business.\nThe market for simulation, data analytics, and high-performance computing software is highly fragmented. Our primary competitors include companies such as IBM, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Siemens, Ansys, MSC Software (a Hexagon company), and Alteryx. Many are large public companies, with significant financial resources. In addition to these competitors, we compete with many smaller companies offering similar software applications.\nA significant number of companies have developed or are developing software and services that currently, or in the future, may compete with some or all of our software and services. We may also face competition from participants in adjacent markets, including two-dimensional, or 2D, and three-dimensional, or 3D, CAD, and broader PLM competitors and others that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and partnering with or acquiring other companies.\nThe principal competitive factors in our industry include:\n\u2022\nbreadth, depth and integration of software;\n\u2022\ndomain expertise of sales and technical support personnel;\n\u2022\nconsistent global support;\n\u2022\nperformance and reliability; and\n\u2022\nprice.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer-term and more extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those customers. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their offerings than we can. These competitors could incorporate additional functionality into their competing products from their wider product offerings or leverage their commercial relationships in a manner that uses product bundling or closed technology platforms to discourage enterprises from purchasing our applications.\nMany existing and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as:\n\u2022\nlarger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u2022\naccess to larger customer bases, which often provide incumbency advantages;\n\u2022\nbroader global distribution and presence;\n\u2022\ngreater resources to make acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to bundle competitive offerings with other software and services;\n\u2022\ngreater brand recognition;\n\u2022\nlower labor and development costs;\n\u2022\ngreater levels of aggregate investment in research and development;\n\u2022\nlarger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial, technical, management and other resources.\nThese competitive pressures in our markets or our failure to compete effectively may result in fewer customers, price reductions, licensing of fewer units, increased sales and marketing expenses, reduced revenue and gross profits and loss of market share. Any failure to address these factors could harm our business.\nBecause we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive industry, we are susceptible to factors affecting this industry.\nBillings in the automotive industry accounted for approximately 33% of our 2021 billings. An adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, due to the impacts of COVID-19 or otherwise, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, rapid technological obsolescence, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our automotive customers\u2019 production schedules, supply disruptions, or labor disturbances, that results in a significant decline in the volume of sales in this industry, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in this industry, could adversely affect our business.\nThe automotive industry is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. Any weakness in demand in this industry, the insolvency of a manufacturer or suppliers, or constriction of credit markets may cause our automotive customers to reduce their amount of software licensed or services requested or request discounts or extended payment terms, any of which may cause fluctuations or a decrease in our revenues and timing of cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or other potential future pandemics or events, may cause severe business interruptions either globally or regionally, that could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has infected populations within the United States and many other regions at fluctuating rates, a phenomenon often characterized as \u201cwaves\u201d of infection. In recent months, infection and hospitalization rates in certain regions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been increasing largely due to the emergence of discovered variants that are thought to be more contagious. The pandemic continues to evolve, as evidenced by the recent \"Omicron variant\" reports. Vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and are being administered in the United States and other countries around the world, but the expansion of administering these vaccines to additional people within these and other countries, the long-term efficacy of these vaccines, and the receptivity of many people to receiving these vaccines all remain uncertain.\nParts of our business have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely affect the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has increased economic and stock market volatility and uncertainty. In response to the pandemic, government authorities have implemented measures to try to contain the virus or mitigate the harm, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses. Some of the most severe, temporary measures by government authorities have been lifted in many jurisdictions but could be reinstated at any time, and they have and may continue to adversely affect our sales activities, operations and growth prospects. These restrictions, and changes in consumer and business spending behavior prompted by the pandemic, have forced businesses in the United States and other jurisdictions to reduce or suspend their operations, lay-off employees, and in some cases shutdown operations.\nAdditional risks from COVID-19 include the inability of our employees and those businesses upon which we rely for operations to carry out their responsibilities at levels of performance necessary to maintain our performance undisturbed as a result of measures taken by governmental authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us, or that we currently to do not consider presenting significant risks to our operations.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on some of our customers has primarily contributed to the decrease in revenue for client engineering services. While we continue to robustly engage with our customers, primarily virtually, to mitigate the uncertain extent of the negative\nimpact of COVID-19 on our customers, our ability to attract, serve, retain, or expand customers will continue to be uncertain. A negative impact on our customers may cause them to delay entering into new or expanded software licenses, request extended payment terms, delayed invoicing, higher discounts, lower renewal amounts or cancelations, and a reduction in demand for software related and client engineering services. Existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to COVID-19, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSince we have substantial international operations that arise from our normal business operations, our financial results in 2022 may be impacted by COVID-19 driven variations in foreign currency exchange rates, apart from the traditional elements that underlie foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nAdverse global conditions, including economic uncertainty, may negatively impact our financial results.\nGlobal conditions, dislocations in the financial markets, any negative financial impacts affecting United States corporations operating on a global basis as a result of tax reform or changes to existing trade agreements or tax conventions, or inflation, could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our software license fees, reduced licensing renewals, customer disruption or foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn addition, the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics, instability in global economic markets, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes with other countries, instability in the global credit markets, supply chain weaknesses, instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and other political tensions, and foreign governmental debt concerns. Such challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets.\nDuring challenging economic times our customers may be unable or unwilling to make timely payments to us, which could cause us to incur increased bad debt expenses. Our customers may unilaterally extend the payment terms of our invoices, adversely affecting our short-term or long-term cash flows.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations and our key metrics, including Billings, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, may vary significantly in the future and seasonally. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which often coincide with the calendar year. These seasonal trends materially affect our financial results, as license fees become due at the time the license term commences based upon agreed payment terms that customers may not adhere to. As a result, new and renewal licenses have been concentrated in the first and fourth quarter of the year, and our cash flows from operations have been highest late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter of the succeeding fiscal year. Period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. The results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and key metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in customer purchasing patterns;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and/or increase sales to existing customers at various times;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through their acquisitions or industry consolidations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenues;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of billings;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe length of sales cycles;\n\u2022\nsignificant security breaches, technical difficulties or unforeseen interruptions to the functionality of our software;\n\u2022\nthe number of new employees added;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of billing for professional services engagements;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new products, features, enhancements or functionalities introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technology;\n\u2022\nany future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nBillings have historically been highest in the first and fourth quarters of any calendar year and may vary in future quarters. This seasonality or the occurrence of any of the factors above may cause our results of operations to vary and our financial statements may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nIn addition, we may choose to grow our business for the long-term rather than to optimize for profitability or cash flows for a particular shorter-term period. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Class A common stock could decline and we could face lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenue and operating results.\nAs a result of our international activities, we have revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies including Euros, British Pounds Sterling, Indian Rupees, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from the net difference between non-United States dollar receipts from customers and non-United States dollar operating expenses. The value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar can fluctuate significantly, and those fluctuations may occur quickly. We cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency fluctuations.\nStrengthening of the United States dollar could cause our software to become relatively more expensive to some of our customers leading to decreased sales and a reduction in billings and revenue not denominated in United States dollars. A reduction in revenue or an increase in operating expenses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may make it more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and operating results.\nWe do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place, and the cost of those hedging techniques may have a significant negative impact on our operating results. The use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments. If we are not able to successfully manage or hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to attract new or retain existing third-party independent software vendors to participate in the APA, we may not be able to grow the APA program.\nOur APA program allows our customers to use third-party software that may be unrelated to our software, without the need to enter into additional license agreements. The APA program results in increased revenues through revenue sharing, and encourages users to stay within the Altair software ecosystem. If third-party software providers are unwilling to join the APA on appropriate terms, including agreeing with our revenue share allocations, or if we are unable to retain our current APA participants, we may not be able to grow the APA program.\nLicensing of our software is dependent, in part, on performance of our distributors and resellers.\nWe have historically licensed our software primarily through our direct sales force. We have enhanced our units licensing model such that it is able to be licensed through a network of distributors and resellers. If these distributors and resellers are unable to successfully adjust their sales methods to support our annual recurring licensing model, or become unstable, financially insolvent, or otherwise do not perform as we expect, our revenue growth derived from the distributor and reseller channels could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to adapt to technology changes our software may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate customer needs;\n\u2022\nforesee changes in technology, including to cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser and database technologies;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our software;\n\u2022\nmaintain operability of our software with changing technology standards; and\n\u2022\ndevelop or acquire additional or complementary technologies.\nWe may not be able to develop or market new or enhanced software in a timely manner, which could result in our software becoming less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete.\nWe believe our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus on growth, which may negatively impact our profitability in the near term.\nPart of our business strategy is to focus on our long-term growth. As a result, our profitability may be lower in the near term than it would be if our strategy were to maximize short-term profitability. Expanding our research and development efforts, sales and marketing efforts, infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business or cause higher long-term profitability. If we are ultimately unable to achieve greater profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders, our Class A common stock price may decline.\nOur research and development may not generate revenue or yield expected benefits.\nA key element of our strategy is to focus on innovation and invest significantly in research and development to create new software and enhance our existing software to address additional applications and serve new markets, both internally and through acquisitions. Research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive, and there may be delays between the time we incur expenses and the time we are able to generate revenue, if any. Anticipated customer demand for any software we may develop could decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we could be unable to avoid costs associated with the development of any such software. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the timely introduction or improvement of software that is competitive in our current or future markets, it could harm our business.\nIf we lose our senior executives, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of James Scapa, our chief executive officer, and other senior executives. Many members of this executive team have served the Company for more than 15 years, with Mr. Scapa having served since our founding in 1985. Loss of Mr. Scapa\u2019s services or those of other senior executives could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nAcquisitions may dilute our stockholders, disrupt our core business, divert our resources, or require significant management attention.\nMost of our software has been developed internally with acquisitions used to augment our capabilities. We may not effectively identify, evaluate, integrate, or use acquired technology or personnel from prior or future acquisitions, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition, including accounting charges.\nAfter the completion of an acquisition, it is possible that our valuation of such acquisition for purchase price allocation purposes may change compared to initial expectations and result in unanticipated write-offs or charges, impairment of our goodwill, or a material change to the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with a particular acquisition.\nWe may pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to fund an acquisition. The payment of cash will decrease available cash. The incurrence of debt would likely increase our fixed obligations and could subject us to restrictive covenants or obligations. The issuance of equity securities would likely be dilutive to our stockholders. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities as a result of acquiring companies. Future acquisition activity may disrupt our core business, divert our resources, or require significant management attention.\nInternational operations expose us to risks inherent in international activities.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our software for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange risk;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation, including uncertainty regarding renegotiation of international trade agreements and partnerships;\n\u2022\nsales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u2022\nenhanced difficulties of integrating foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and working with foreign partners;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, and collections issues;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, employment, ownership, trade, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nmore restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other tax obligations on remittance and other payments made by our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional, economic and political conditions.\nOur inability to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to match engineers to open positions in our CES business or are otherwise unable to grow our CES business, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nWe operate our client engineering services business by hiring engineers and data scientists for placement at a customer site for specific customer-directed assignments and pay them only for the duration of the placement. The success of this business is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled, CES staff to meet the requirements of our customers and to maintain ongoing relationships with these customers. Our CES business constituted approximately 7% and 9% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Some of our customers satisfy their engineering personnel needs through managed service providers, or MSPs. A significant percentage of the engineers we place, either directly or through MSPs, are with U.S.-based customers and are citizens of countries other than the United States. In the event these engineers are unable to enter into, or remain in, the United States legally, we may be unable to match engineers with the appropriate skill sets matched to open customer positions. If we are unable to attract highly skilled, qualified CES staff because of competitive factors or immigration laws, or otherwise fail to match CES staff to open customer positions, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nOur sales to government agencies and their suppliers may be subject to reporting and compliance requirements.\nOur customers include agencies of the various governments, including, but not limited to the United States, and their suppliers of products and services. These customers may procure our software and services through various governments\u2019 mandated procurement regulations. Because of governmental reporting and compliance requirements, we may incur unexpected costs. Government agencies and their suppliers may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future operating results.\nOur revenue mix may vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and operating results.\nOur revenue mix may vary over time due to a number of factors, including the mix of term-based licenses and perpetual licenses. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to our term-based licenses, perpetual licenses and professional services, shifts in the mix between subscription and perpetual licenses from quarter to quarter, or increases or decreases in revenue derived from our professional engineering services, which have lower gross margins than our software services, could produce substantial variation in revenues recognized even if our billings remain consistent. Our gross margins and operating results could be impacted by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with other factors, including entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures; pricing discounts; and increased price competition. Any one of these factors or the cumulative effects of certain of these factors may result in significant fluctuations in our gross margin and operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet internal expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for a\nparticular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could harm our business.\nUnder GAAP, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we had $370.2 million and $264.5 million of goodwill and $99.0 million and $76.1 million of other intangible assets-net. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.\nIn addition to our software, we source, distribute and sell products, which may expose us to product liability claims, product recalls, and warranty claims that could be expensive and harm our business.\nWe source, distribute and sell products, in part, through certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. To the extent these products do not perform as expected, cause injury or death or are otherwise unsuitable for usage, we may be held liable for claims, including product liability and other claims. A product liability claim, any product recalls or an excessive warranty claim, whether arising from defects in design or failure in our supply chains could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design process or our product sourcing, any of which may harm our reputation and business.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nDefects or errors in our software could result in loss of revenue or harm to our reputation.\nOur software is complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain undetected or perceived bugs, defects, errors, or failures. From time to time we have found defects or errors in our software and we may discover additional defects in the future. We may not find defects or errors in new or enhanced software before release and these defects or errors may not be discovered by us or our customers until after they have used the software. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases or updates of our software to remedy bugs, defects and errors or failures. The occurrence of any real or perceived bugs, defects, errors, or failures could result in:\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance of our software;\n\u2022\ndelays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources;\n\u2022\nloss of competitive position;\n\u2022\nclaims by customers for losses sustained by them;\n\u2022\nbreach of contract claims or related liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreased customer support expenses or financial concessions; and\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs.\nAny of these problems could harm our business.\nFailure to protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under trade secret, patent, trademark, and copyright laws. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Provisions in our license agreements protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology, but such provisions may be difficult to enforce or are unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and countries. The laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our international activities expose us to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information.\nWe primarily rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. The contractual provisions that we enter into with employees, consultants, partners, vendors and customers may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or trade secrets.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technologies, software and intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. We may be unable to detect or determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our software, technologies or intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time, we may need to engage in litigation or other administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against allegations by third parties that we have infringed or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, including in connection with requests for indemnification by our customers who may face such claims. We have been approached and may be approached in the future by certain of our customers to indemnify them against third-party intellectual property claims. Litigation and/or any requests for indemnification by our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business and revenue. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our business may be harmed.\nIntellectual property disputes could result in significant costs and harm our business.\nIntellectual property disputes may occur in the markets in which we compete. Many of our competitors are large companies with significant intellectual property portfolios, which they may use to assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers. Any allegation of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third-party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business, and could cause uncertainty among our customers or prospective customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business or revenue.\nOur agreements may include provisions that require us to indemnify others for losses suffered or incurred as a result of our infringement of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights infringement, including certain of our employees and customers.\nAn adverse outcome of a dispute or an indemnity claim may require us to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\ncease licensing our software or portions of it;\n\u2022\ndevelop non-infringing technologies;\n\u2022\nacquire or license non-infringing technologies; and\n\u2022\nmake substantial indemnification payments.\nAny of the foregoing or other damages could harm our business, decrease our revenue, increase our expenses or negatively impact our cash flow.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, computer hacking attacks and other security incidents could harm our business, reputation, brand and operating results.\nSecurity incidents have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems. Security incidents may be caused by, or result in but are not limited to, security breaches, computer malware or malicious software, computer hacking, unauthorized access to confidential information, denial of service attacks, security system control failures in our own systems or from vendors we use, email phishing, software vulnerabilities, social engineering, sabotage and drive-by downloads. Such security incidents, whether intentional or otherwise, may result from actions of hackers, criminals, nation states, vendors, employees or customers.\nOur company is a highly automated business which relies on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, third-party providers of cloud-based services, internal technology systems and website for development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. A disruption or failure of these systems or in those of our external service providers, in the event of a major storm, earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe may experience disruptions, data loss, outages and other performance problems on our systems due to service attacks, unauthorized access or other security related incidents. Any security breach or loss of system control caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain\nunauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss, modification or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment and the inadvertent transmission of computer malware could harm our business.\nIn addition, some of our software may store and transmit customers\u2019 confidential business information in our facilities and on our equipment, networks, corporate systems and in the cloud. Security incidents could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. Our customer data, corporate systems, and security measures may be compromised due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, third-party software, capacity constraints, a combination of these or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our information. We must continuously examine and modify our security controls and business policies to address new threats, the use of new devices and technologies, and these efforts may be costly or distracting.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient control measures to defend against these techniques. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific incident or breach, any failure to maintain confidentiality, availability, integrity, performance and reliability of our systems and infrastructure may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. If an actual or perceived security incident occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security controls could be harmed, our brand and reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and we could suffer financial exposure due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts, investigation costs, regulatory fines and changed security control, system architecture and system protection measures.\nWe may lose customers if our software does not work seamlessly with our customers\u2019 existing software.\nOur customers may use our software, which in many instances has been designed to seamlessly interface with software from some of our competitors, together with their own software and software they license from third parties. If our software ceases to work seamlessly with our customers\u2019 existing software applications, we may lose customers.\nMany of our customers use our software and services to design and develop their products, which when built and used may expose us to claims.\nMany of our customers use our software and services, together with software and services from other third parties and their own resources, to assist in the design and development of products intended to be used in a commercial setting. To the extent our customers design or develop a product that results in potential liability, including product liability, we may be included in resulting litigation. We may be subject to litigation defense costs or be subject to potential judgments or settlement costs for which we may not be fully covered by insurance, which would result in an increase of our expenses.\nWe also license certain of our software on Altair branded computer hardware, which we acquire from original equipment manufacturers, which we refer to as OEMs, exposing us to potential liability for the hardware, such as product liability. To the extent this liability is greater than the warranty and liability protection from our OEM, we may incur additional expenses, which may be significant.\nIf we fail to educate and train our users regarding the use and benefits of our software, we may not generate additional revenue.\nOur software is complex and highly technical. We continually educate and train our existing and potential users regarding the depth, breadth, and benefits of our software including through classroom and online training. If these users do not receive education and training regarding the use and benefits of our software, or the education and training is ineffective, they may not increase their usage of our software. We may incur costs of training directly related to this activity prior to generating additional revenue.\nWe currently open source certain of our software and may open source other software in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and expenses and our use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our software.\nWe offer our open matrix language, or OML, source code and a portion of our Altair PBS workload management software in an open source version to generate additional usage and broaden user-community development and enhancement of the software. We offer related software and services on a paid basis. We believe increased usage of open source software leads to increased purchases of these related paid offerings. We may offer additional software on an open source basis in the future. There is no assurance that the incremental revenues from related paid offerings will outweigh the lost revenues and incurred expenses attributable to the open sourced software.\nWe use open source software in some of our software and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our software to conditions we do not intend, we may face allegations from others alleging ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open\nsource software, derivative works, or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These allegations could also result in litigation. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts. There is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our software. In such an event, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue commercially offering our software, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our software or to discontinue the sale of our software if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business and revenue.\nThe use of open source software subjects us to a number of other risks and challenges. Open source software is subject to further development or modification by anyone. Others may develop such software to be competitive with or no longer useful by us. It is also possible for competitors to develop their own solutions using open source software, potentially reducing the demand for our software. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business and operating results may be adversely affected, and our development costs may increase.\nRisks related to legal or regulatory matters\nWe operate internationally and must comply with employment and related laws in various countries, which may, in turn, result in unexpected expenses.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, discrimination, whistle-blower, privacy and data protection, employment of unauthorized or undocumented employees, classification of employees, wages, statutory benefits, and severance payments. Such laws are subject to change as a result of judicial decisions or otherwise, and there can be no assurance that we will not be found to have violated any such laws in the future. Such violations could lead to the assessment of significant fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or to the award of damages claims, including severance payments, against us in judicial or administrative proceedings by employees or former employees, any of which would reduce our net income or increase our net loss.\nChanges in government trade, immigration or currency policies may harm our business.\nWe operate our business globally in multiple countries that have policies and regulations relating to trade, immigration and currency, which may change. Governments may change their trade policies by withdrawing from negotiations on new trade policies, renegotiating existing trade agreements, imposing tariffs or imposing other trade restrictions or barriers. Any such changes may result in:\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in political or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements or other restrictions on technology imports and exports;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\nmodification of existing or implementation of new tariffs;\n\u2022\nimposition or increase of trade barriers; or\n\u2022\nestablishment of new trade or currency restrictions.\nAny of these changes, changes in immigration policies, government intervention in currency valuation or other government policy changes may adversely impact our ability to sell software and services, which could, in turn, harm our revenues and our business. We are headquartered in the United States and may be particularly impacted by changes affecting the United States.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur software, services and hardware are subject to export control and import laws and regulations. As a company headquartered in the United States we are subject to regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, United States Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, presenting further risk of unexpected reporting and compliance costs. Compliance with these regulations may also prevent and restrict us from deriving revenue from potential customers in certain geographic locations for certain of our technologies.\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales\nopportunities. In addition, changes in our software or changes in applicable export or import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our software in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our software or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our software to certain countries, governments or persons altogether.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into portions of our software. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our software or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our software in those countries. Encrypted software and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our software, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our software, including with respect to new releases of our software, may create delays in the introduction of our software in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our software throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our software to some countries altogether.\nUnited States export control laws and economic sanction programs prohibit the shipment of certain software and services to countries, governments and persons that are subject to United States economic embargoes and trade sanctions, including, but not limited to, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. Any violations of such economic embargoes and trade sanction regulations could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our software by, or in our decreased ability to export or license our software to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our software or limitation on our ability to export or license our software could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety and environmental laws, privacy and data protection laws, financial services laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. These laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus we must continue to monitor and dedicate resources to ensure continued compliance. Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we or any of our employees violate the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws we could be adversely affected.\nThe FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business to government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients. United States based companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. We operate in areas of the world that potentially experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our employees, resellers or distributors will not engage in prohibited conduct. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets in the United States, which we may not use in future taxable periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had gross deferred tax assets, or DTAs, of $153.7 million and $133.4 million, respectively, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, share-based compensation, lease obligations and employee benefits. We are entitled to a United States federal tax deduction when non-qualified stock options, or NSOs, are exercised. This deduction, in conjunction with our other expected deferred tax asset reversals, resulted in an increase in the valuation allowance of $20.4 million in 2021 for the United States DTAs. Our ability to utilize any net operating losses or tax credits may be limited under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, if we undergo an ownership change after our IPO (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change, by value, in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period). We also inherited net operating losses, or NOLs, from the acquisition of Datawatch and Univa, which are subject to specific limitations on\nusage. We may or may not be able to realize the benefits of the acquired NOLs due to a number of factors, including those enumerated above. We may also be unable to realize our tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiry.\nIf our global tax methodology is challenged, our tax expense may increase.\nAs a global business headquartered in the United States, we are required to pay tax in a number of different countries, exposing us to transfer pricing and other adjustments. Transfer pricing refers to the methodology of allocating revenue and expenses for tax purposes to particular countries. Taxing authorities may challenge our transfer pricing methodology, which if successful could increase our professional expenses and result in one-time or recurring tax charges, a higher worldwide effective tax rate, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nOur tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding and other taxes including taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions under the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we have business operations. Our future income taxes may fluctuate if there is a change in the mix of income in the applicable tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to review and audit by the United States and other taxing authorities. Any review or audit could increase our professional expenses and, if determined adversely, could result in unexpected costs.\nSales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. Any of these jurisdictions may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Potential changes in existing tax laws, including future regulatory guidance, may impact our effective income tax rate and tax payments. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may collect personal information and is subject to data protection laws.\nCompanies that collect or process personal information may be regulated by data protection laws adopted by the United States, various states including California, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado, and foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and China. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation and implementing legislation adopted by member states of the European Economic Area (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in 2018, and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018 (the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d) frequently serve as a model for other countries. All of these data protection laws regulate the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information, such as names, email addresses, Internet Protocol addresses and other online identifiers, business contact data, and customer profiles, that may be used to identify or locate an individual, including customers, employees, business contracts, website visitors and users of mobile apps.\nThe legal, financial and business impact of these data protection laws and regulations is far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We may be required to implement privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access and correct their own personal information that is collected, stored or maintained by us, and require us to transfer, delete or return their personal information. It may also be necessary for us to obtain individuals\u2019 affirmative consent to collect, use or disclose their personal information for certain purposes. Governmental authorities could prohibit any personal information collected in a country from being transferred or disclosed outside of that country or condition such transfer or disclosure on compliance with specific requirements or written agreements. We also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other information security, or data protection, related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to information security and data protection. We may agree to be bound by additional contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data. Our failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in governmental actions, fines and non-monetary penalties, or civil actions, and reputational damage, which may harm our business.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business.\nThe GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, applies to all our business conducted in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d). In the post-Brexit area, our business in the United Kingdom is regulated by the U.K. GDPR. New data protection laws have just come into effect in Brazil and China, and a new Indian law is pending. In the US, the states of California, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada have enacted new data protection laws that become effective during the next calendar year, and similar laws are pending in New York, Massachusetts and Washington. These data protection laws and regulations impose many obligations, and we will need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to compliance and training in the coming years. Data protection laws, for example, may require, that regulated entities expand disclosures about how personal data is used, mechanisms for obtaining consent from data subjects, controls for data subjects with respect to their personal data (including by enabling them to exercise rights to erasure and data portability), limitations on retention of personal data and mandatory data breach notifications. There are also restrictions on data transfers and the security of the personal data, frequently with substantial fines and penalties associated with violations. The GDPR, for example, provides that supervisory authorities in the European Union may impose administrative fines for certain infringements of the GDPR (up to EUR 20,000,000, or 4% of an undertaking\u2019s total, worldwide, annual revenue, whichever is higher). Individuals who sustain damages because a regulated entity fails to comply with the GDPR have the right to seek compensation from such entity directly. Compliance with data protection laws, the rapid pace of adopting new and amended laws, and necessary monitoring and training will require significant expenditure of resources on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken for the purposes of compliance will be successful in preventing violations of such laws, cyber-attacks, governmental actions or civil proceedings. Given the potential fines, liabilities and damage to our reputation in the event of an actual or perceived violation of data protection laws, any violation may have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAs the number of jurisdictions with data privacy regulations increase and our global footprint expands, we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to increase the amount we expend on compliance and training in this area.\nRisks related to ownership of our Class A common stock\nAn active public trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cALTR.\u201d However, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the price of shares of Class A common stock. An inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and our ability to use our capital stock to acquire other companies or technologies. We cannot predict the prices at which our Class A common stock will trade.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock can be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has and may continue to fluctuate from time to time. Our market price may continue to fluctuate substantially depending on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock, since you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industries in particular;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nadditional shares of our Class A common stock being sold into the market by our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales, including sales of our Class A common stock upon exercise of outstanding options or upon conversion of our Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nfailure of financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new software or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\npublic analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our customers\u2019 businesses, or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nany major changes in our management or our board of directors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from major weather events, war, potential global health issues, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company will be if the market price of our Class A common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on a timely basis, or to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or share price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent financial fraud. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or collusion, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our share price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of SOX requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We have designed, implemented and tested the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which was and is time consuming, costly, and complicated. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the past, we have identified material weaknesses in our controls which we subsequently remediated. We cannot assure investors that we will not have material weaknesses in the future. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future or if we are unable to successfully remediate the identified material weaknesses or, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe cannot predict the impact our capital structure may have on our stock price.\nIn July 2017, S&P Dow Jones, a provider of widely followed stock indices, announced that companies with multiple share classes, such as ours, will not be eligible for inclusion in certain of their indices. As a result, our Class A common stock will likely not be eligible for these stock indices. Additionally, FTSE Russell, another provider of widely followed stock indices, has stated that it plans to require new constituents of its indices to have at least five percent of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders. Many investment funds are precluded from investing in companies that are not included in such indices, and these funds would be unable to purchase our Class A common stock. We cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take a similar approach to S&P Dow Jones or FTSE Russell in the future. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from indices could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf financial or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable commentary or downgrade our Class A common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. As a relatively new public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage, and the analysts who publish information about our Class A common stock still have relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or often times failed to exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet, or fail to significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our Class A common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and may make it more difficult to sell Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 51,524,497 shares of Class A common stock and 27,744,574 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nShares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements.\nWe have registered the offer and sale of an aggregate of approximately 27,562,692 shares of Class A common stock that have been issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans on a Form S-8 registration statement. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, unless they are held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Additionally, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for grant and issuance under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan is subject to an automatic annual increase on January 1 of each year beginning in 2018 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 3% of the number of shares of all classes of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year or (ii) a lesser number of shares of Class A common stock determined by our board of directors. We also intend to register the offer and sale of any shares of Class A common stock resulting from such increases. If the holders of these shares choose to sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock.\nWe may also issue shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders who hold shares of our Class B common stock, including our founders, certain of our directors and executive officers and affiliates, who hold in the aggregate approximately 84% of the voting power of our capital stock. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Class B stockholders, including our founders, certain of our directors and executive officers, and affiliates, hold, in the aggregate approximately 84% of the voting power of our capital stock. The ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, results in the holders of our Class B common stock collectively controlling a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore being able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until 2029, or upon the occurrence of a triggering event at which time all shares of our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock, or on an earlier date, as set forth in our Delaware certificate of incorporation.\nThis concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to the specific exceptions set forth in our Delaware certificate of incorporation, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes and between or among our founders. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Delaware certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a dual class common stock structure for 12 years following the completion of our IPO;\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nrequiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, or repeal provisions of (i) our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval, voting rights of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, and management of our business, and (ii) our bylaws relating to the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting and amending our bylaws in their entirety, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from\nconducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our Class A common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur 0.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, or the Convertible Notes, are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Convertible Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Convertible Notes (including all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility) will be available to pay obligations on the Convertible Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the Convertible Notes only after all claims senior to the Convertible Notes have been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Convertible Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes will not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.\nThe Convertible Notes are our obligations only and a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and a substantial portion of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries.\nThe Convertible Notes are our obligations exclusively and are not guaranteed by any of our operating subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our operations is conducted through, and a substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by, our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, including the Convertible Notes, depends in part on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our obligations, including the Convertible Notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make payments on the Convertible Notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. In addition, dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries may be subject to contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our future indebtedness, including the amounts payable under our revolving credit facility and the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Convertible Notes when due. Our existing revolving credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and our current debt contains, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a defined repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness including our existing revolving credit facility. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the occurrence of a fundamental change itself would likely also lead to a default under our revolving credit facility and may lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nOur revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay any cash amount upon the conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.\nOur existing revolving credit facility prohibits us from making any cash payments on the conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes if a default under such credit facility exists or would be created thereby. In addition, our ability to make cash payments on the conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes will be limited to the extent we do not satisfy certain financial covenant tests after giving effect to such payments. Any new credit facility that we may enter into may have similar restrictions. Our failure to make cash payments upon the conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes as required under the terms of the Convertible Notes would permit holders of the Convertible Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Convertible Notes.\nOur loan agreements contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur credit agreement, as amended, provides for an initial aggregate commitment amount of $150 million, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $5 million and a sublimit for swing line loans of up to $5 million and matures on December 15, 2023 (the \u201c2019 Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). Our 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by us and all existing and subsequently acquired controlled domestic subsidiaries. It is also collateralized by a first priority, perfected security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of our tangible assets. The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement contains operating financial restrictions and covenants, including liens, limitations on indebtedness, fundamental changes, limitations on guarantees, limitations on sales of assets and sales of receivables, dividends, distributions and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, prepayment of indebtedness and limitations on loans and investments in each case subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants relating to maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, and maximum net leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0, as defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. The restrictions and covenants in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, as well as those contained in any future debt financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the loan agreement and any future financing agreements that we may enter into.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nIf the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, our Convertible Notes will be convertible in the next calendar quarter (the \u201cSale Price Condition\u201d). At present, the conversion price is approximately $46.50; 130% of such price is approximately $60.45. The closing sale price of our Class A common stock has met or exceed $60.45 during the current or future calendar quarters, although we cannot presently determine whether the Sale Price Condition will be satisfied with respect to the current calendar quarter. If the Sale Price Condition is satisfied during the current or future calendar quarters, our Convertible Notes will be convertible during the succeeding calendar quarter.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our Class A common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of Class A common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. As our stock price increases, the number of shares of Class A common stock used in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share also increases, which will adversely affect our diluted earnings per share.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 815-40, Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, that change the accounting for the convertible debt instruments. Under the new standard, an entity may no longer separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. Additionally, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible debt instruments and requires the use of the \u201cif converted\u201d method. Application of the \u201cif converted\u201d method may negatively affect our diluted earnings per share. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2022.\nTransactions relating to the Convertible Notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes. If holders of our Convertible Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled software engineers, data scientists, salespeople, and support teams. There is significant industry competition for these individuals. We have many employees whose equity awards in our company are fully vested and may increase their personal wealth, which could affect their decision to remain with the Company. Failure to attract or retain key personnel could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nWe may require additional capital to support our business, which may not be available on acceptable terms.\nWe expect to continue to make investments in our business, which may require us to raise additional funds. We may raise these funds through either equity or debt financings. Issuances of equity or convertible debt securities may significantly dilute stockholders and any new equity securities could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those holders of our Class A common stock. In addition to the restrictions under our current credit agreement, any future debt financings could contain restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital, manage our business and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our growth, develop new software or add capabilities and enhancements to our existing software and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth included in our periodic reports or other public disclosures may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts included in our periodic reports or other public disclosures, including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted in our periodic reports or other public disclosures, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and our customers are vulnerable to interruptions by fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, pandemics, environmental and climate change, and other events beyond our control. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, including system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our software development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data.\nWe rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and applications, internal technology systems, and our websites for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services and sales activities. If these systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver software and training to our customers could be impaired.\nOur business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of these events, if at all.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior and subsequent to such change. The adoption of new standards may require enhancements or changes in our systems and will continue to require significant time and effort of our financial management team.\nWe cannot predict the impact of all of the future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our consolidated financial statements going forward, which could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of the change. In addition, if we were to change our critical accounting estimates, including those related to the recognition of license revenue and other revenue sources, our operating results could be significantly affected.",

We expect to add facilities as we grow our employee base and expand geographically. We do not manage our facilities by segment because they may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, and development.

    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWorld Programming\nWe acquired World Programming in December 2021. In 2010 SAS Institute, Inc. (\u201cSAS\u201d) filed an action against World Programing in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement to contract, and violations of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA). SAS was unsuccessful on its copyright claims but prevailed on its breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, and UDTPA claims and was awarded damages of $79.1 million in 2016 (the \u201cNC Judgment\u201d). The North Carolina District Court subsequently enjoined World Programming from licensing its WPL software to new customers for use in the United States until the NC Judgment was satisfied. At the time that we acquired World Programming, World Programming had partially paid the NC Judgment. On January 3, 2022, we paid the outstanding balance of $65.9 million on the NC Judgment. Despite payment in full, SAS has asserted that we have not satisfied the Judgment. A hearing to address this issue is scheduled for March 2022.\nIn 2018, SAS filed litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas asserting that World Programming infringed SAS copyrights and patents. SAS voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its patent claims, and the Texas court entered judgment in favor of World Programming on the copyright claims. SAS appealed this judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A decision from the Court of Appeals is pending.\nOther legal proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish and enforce our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.",

We currently do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The terms of our 2019 Amended Credit Agreement also restrict our ability to pay dividends, and we may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements (and notes thereto) for the year ended December 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in \u201cRisk factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader in computational science and artificial intelligence enabling organizations across broad industry segments to drive smarter decisions in an increasingly connected world. We deliver software and cloud solutions in the areas of simulation, high-performance computing (\u201cHPC\u201d), data analytics, and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d). Our products and services help create a more sustainable future for our planet.\nOur simulation and AI-driven approach to innovation is powered by our broad portfolio of high-fidelity and high-performance physics solvers, our market-leading technology for optimization and HPC, and our end-to-end platform for developing AI and Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) solutions. Our integrated suite of software optimizes design performance across multiple disciplines encompassing structures, motion, fluids, thermal, electromagnetics, system modeling, and embedded systems, while also providing AI solutions and true-to-life visualization and rendering. Our HPC solutions maximize the efficient utilization of complex compute resources and streamline the workflow management of compute-intensive tasks for applications including AI, modeling and simulation, and visualization. Our data analytics, AI and IoT products include data preparation, data science, MLOps, orchestration, and visualization solutions that fuel engineering, scientific, and business decisions.\nAltair\u2019s software products represent a comprehensive, open architecture solution for simulation, HPC, data analytics, and AI to empower decision making for improved product design and development, manufacturing, energy management and exploration, financial services, health care, and retail operations. We believe Altair\u2019s solutions are compelling due to their openness and usability.\nAltair\u2019s products offer a comprehensive set of technologies to design and optimize high-performance, efficient, innovative and sustainable products and processes in an increasingly connected world. Our products are categorized by:\n\u2022\nPhysics Simulation and Concept Design;\n\u2022\nHigh Performance and Cloud Computing; and\n\u2022\nData Analytics, AI, IoT and Smart Product Development.\nAltair also provides Client Engineering Services, or CES, to support our customers with long-term ongoing expertise. This has the benefit of embedding us within customers, deepening our understanding of their processes, and allowing us to more quickly perceive trends in the overall market. Our presence at our customers\u2019 sites helps us to better tailor our software products\u2019 research and development, or R&D, and sales initiatives.\nLicensing\nThere are two licensing methods we employ to deliver our software solutions:\n\u2022\nMost products are available under our unique, patented units-based licensing model known as Altair Units.\n\u2022\nA small subset of our products is available on a node-locked, or hardware specific, and named-user basis. This is especially true for our high-performance computing solutions.\nAltair pioneered a patented units-based subscription licensing model for software and other digital content. This units-based subscription licensing model allows flexible and shared access to our offerings, along with over 150 partner products. Our customers license a pool of units for their organizations giving individual users access to our portfolio of software applications as well as our growing portfolio of partner products. We believe our units-based subscription licensing model lowers barriers to adoption, creates broad engagement, encourages users to work within our ecosystem, and increases revenue. This, in turn, helps drive our recurring software license rate which has been on average approximately 90% over the past five years. Each year approximately 60% of new software revenue comes from expansion within existing customers.\nRecent Business Developments\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern. The global spread of COVID-19, including new and emerging variants, has created significant volatility and uncertainty since March 2020 and may continue into the future.\nThe ensuing discussion is provided to summarize the impacts of COVID-19 upon the Company, inclusive of some of the principal measures undertaken by the Company to date to respond to the pandemic. It is difficult to predict with any level of precision the broad effects of COVID-19 on specific industries or individual companies. Locally or regionally imposed restrictions in concert with the duration of pandemic conditions, along with the development and distribution of vaccines, may create disparate impacts across the globe, including the primary countries or regions in which the Company and its customers operate.\nWe have adopted several measures in response to COVID-19 adhering to local and regional restrictions, including instructing employees to work from home, adjusting our expenses and cash flow to correlate with potential declines in billings and cash collections from customers, shifting certain of our customer events to online-only webcasts and restricting non-critical business travel by our employees. Historically, a portion of field sales, professional services and other activities were conducted in person. Currently, because of travel restrictions related to COVID-19, substantially all of our sales, professional services and other activities are being conducted virtually. We continue to actively monitor business conditions and government mandates related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.\nThroughout this period, our response is focused on maintaining the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners. We are committed to, and we believe we are capable of continuing to provide the same excellent level of service and technical support for our customers during these uncertain times. Our team is highly experienced with remote collaboration, as it is a normal part of our global culture. During this crisis, customers working remotely can move their existing licenses from their on-premises servers to servers utilizing hosted Altair Units, or request temporary term-based software licenses for increased productivity and security. We are also providing access to an increased number of online training, marketing and sales resources.\nWe have converted our business to being capable of operating nearly 100% remote as required or recommended under COVID-19 restrictions, leveraging our global technology infrastructure. While we are capable of sustained operations working remotely, we expect we will gradually resume normalized operations, when permitted, based on local conditions and restrictions, with the primary focus of preserving employee welfare, while continuing to support customers.\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on some of our customers has primarily contributed to the decrease in revenue for client engineering services. While we continue to robustly engage with our customers, primarily virtually, to mitigate the uncertain extent of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our customers, our ability to attract, serve, retain, or expand customers will continue to be uncertain. Existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to COVID-19, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the full scope of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the number and intensity of subsequent waves of infections, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and partners, the development of treatments and vaccines, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nBusiness combinations\nIn December 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of two related privately held companies, World Programming Limited and December 2015 Software Limited (together \u201cWorld Programming\u201d), from the stockholders named therein.\nWorld Programming is an enterprise software company based in the UK having approximately 500 customers globally and focused on data analytics for financial services, insurance, manufacturing, life sciences, energy, consumer products, and retail applications. World Programming\u2019s platform supports development and execution of multi-language software solutions leveraging popular languages used in data science including Python, R, and the SAS language in a single program.\nThe Company expects this acquisition to be accretive, broaden its market opportunities, and contribute to long-term growth goals.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed another business acquisition that was individually insignificant to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The aggregate purchase price of this acquisition was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values.\nWe believe that our recent acquisitions result in certain benefits, including expanding our portfolio of software and products and enabling us to better serve our customer\u2019s requests for data analytics and simulation technology. However, to realize some of these anticipated benefits, the acquired businesses must be successfully integrated. The success of these acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions for a variety of reasons.\nFactors affecting our performance\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business, operating results and prospects could be harmed. See Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality and quarterly results\nOur billings have historically been highest in the first and fourth quarters of any calendar year and may vary in future quarters. The timing of recording billings and the corresponding effect on our cash flows may vary due to the seasonality of the purchasing patterns of our customers. In addition, the timing of the recognition of revenue, the amount and timing of operating expenses, including employee compensation, sales and marketing activities, and capital expenditures, may vary from quarter-to-quarter which may cause our reported results to fluctuate significantly. In addition, we may choose to grow our business for the long-term rather than to optimize for profitability or cash flows for a particular shorter-term period. This seasonality or the occurrence of any of the factors above may cause our results of operations to vary and our financial statements may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nForeign currency fluctuations\nBecause of our substantial international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, as well as our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. To identify changes in our underlying business without regard to the impact of currency fluctuations, we evaluate certain of our operating results both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant currency basis.\nBusiness segments\nWe have identified two reportable segments: Software and Client Engineering Services:\n\u2022\nSoftware -Our Software segment includes software and software related services. The software component of this segment includes our portfolio of software products including our solvers and optimization technology products, high-performance computing software applications and hardware products, modeling and visualization tools, data analytics and analysis products, IoT platform and analytics tools as well as support and the complementary software products we offer through our Altair Partner Alliance, or APA. The APA includes technologies ranging from computational fluid dynamics and fatigue to manufacturing process simulation and cost estimation. The software related services component of this segment includes consulting, implementation services, and training focused on product design and development expertise and analysis from the component level up to complete product engineering at any stage of the lifecycle.\n\u2022\nClient Engineering Services - Our client engineering services, or CES, segment provides client engineering services to support our customers with long-term, ongoing expertise. We operate our CES business by hiring engineers and data scientists for placement at a customer site for specific customer-directed assignments. We employ and pay them only for the duration of the placement.\nOur other businesses which do not meet the criteria to be separate reportable segments are combined and reported as \u201cOther\u201d which represents innovative services and products, including toggled, our LED lighting business. toggled is focused on developing and selling next-generation solid state lighting technology along with communication and control protocols based on our intellectual property for the direct replacement of fluorescent light tubes with LED lamps. Other businesses combined within Other include potential services and product concepts that are still in their development stages.\nFor additional information about our reportable segments and other businesses, see Note 17 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of results of operations\nRevenue\nWe primarily derive revenue from the licensing of our software, which includes our units-based subscription licensing model and for term and perpetual software licenses, as well as software related services. Our CES business derives revenue from providing engineers and data scientists to support our customers\u2019 long-term, ongoing projects.\nSoftware\nSoftware revenue is principally comprised of subscription licenses, and to a lesser extent, perpetual licenses and associated maintenance and support fees. Subscriptions are typically governed by contracts with annual terms which include product updates, maintenance and support. We generally recognize software license revenue up front, while maintenance and support revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract. To a much lesser extent, Software also includes revenue from the sale of hardware products.\nSoftware includes consulting, implementation services and training. Our software related services team is comprised of approximately 350 highly technical people globally. We focus on establishing a strong working relationship with the user community allowing us to offer guidance and expertise throughout their product creation process. We generally recognize revenue for software related services as those services are performed.\nSoftware related services\nConsulting services from product design and development projects are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a time-and-materials, or T&M, or fixed-price basis. Altair recognizes services revenue from our T&M contracts using input-based estimates, utilizing direct labor and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates as the input measure. For fixed-price contracts, software services revenue is recognized over time using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, generally using a cost-input method where revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total cost incurred to estimated total costs at completion. If output or input measures are not available or cannot be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon completion of the services.\nClient engineering services\nWe operate our CES business by hiring engineers and data scientists for placement at a customer site for specific customer-directed assignments. We employ and pay them only for the duration of the placement.\nOur CES business generates revenue from placing simulation specialists, industrial designers, design engineers, materials experts, development engineers, manufacturing engineers, and information technology specialists. We recognize CES revenue based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates.\nOther\nOur Other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to our LED lighting business operated out of our wholly-owned subsidiary, toggled. toggled designs, and sources through contract manufacturers, LED lighting and related products for sale to consumers and businesses. We also generate revenue through royalties from licensing toggled technology to third-party manufacturers and resellers.\nCost of revenue\nCost of software\nCost of software revenue consists of expenses related to software licensing, hardware sales and customer support. Significant expenses include employee compensation and related costs for support team members, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, as well as hardware costs, travel costs, certain data center and facility costs and royalties for third-party software products available to customers through our products or as part of our APA.\nCost of software related services\nCost of software related services revenue consists of personnel and related costs, such as salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, as well as travel expenses and certain data center and facility costs.\nCost of client engineering services\nCost of engineering services revenue consists primarily of employee compensation and related costs. We employ and pay them only for the duration of the placement at a customer site.\nCost of other\nCost of other revenue includes the cost of LED lighting products and freight related to products sold to retail and commercial sales channels.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, as defined and discussed below, support all the products and services that we provide to our customers and, as a result, they are presented in an aggregate total.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs associated with our development team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, professional consulting and development fees, and stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the functionality, breadth and scalability of our software, addressing new use cases, and developing additional innovative technologies. Timely development of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we release new versions of our software on a regular basis. All software development costs are expensed as incurred as our current software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation, as well as costs relating to our marketing and business development programs including trade shows and events. We intend to continue to invest resources in our sales and marketing initiatives to drive growth and extend our market position.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of employee compensation and related costs for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, and employee-related information technology and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, professional fees for external legal and accounting services, depreciation, facilities, recruiting and other consulting services.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions. We expect to incur additional amortization expenses resulting from future strategic acquisitions.\nOther operating income\nOther operating income consists primarily of government subsidies, primarily in France, in the form of grant income associated with certain of our research and development activities and other items as disclosed.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units and interest income on invested cash.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense is comprised primarily of income taxes related to United States, foreign, and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Income tax expense also includes taxes withheld outside of the United States attributable to remittances to the Company from certain foreign subsidiaries. We record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense. We expect the amount of income tax expense (benefit), if any, to vary each reporting period depending upon fluctuations in our quantum and tax jurisdictional mix of income (loss). We have substantial United States net operating loss carryforwards with no expiration period for losses generated\n2018 onwards, and tax credit carryforwards which began to expire in 2018. The ability to utilize these tax attributes is highly dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in the United States in the future.\nOur future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, the taxation of the foreign earnings in the U.S. under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, regime, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, stock-based compensation, business combinations, payments to the Company from certain foreign subsidiaries, closure of statute of limitations, settlements of tax audits, and changes in tax laws including United States tax law changes that were enacted in December 2017. A significant amount of our earnings is generated in our EMEA and APAC regions. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had gross deferred tax assets, or DTAs, of $153.7 million and $133.4 million, respectively, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, share-based compensation, lease obligations and employee benefits. We are entitled to a United States federal tax deduction when non-qualified stock options, or NSOs, are exercised. This deduction, in conjunction with other expected deferred tax asset reversals, resulted in an increase in the valuation allowance of $20.4 million in 2021 for the United States DTAs. Our ability to utilize any net operating losses or tax credits may be limited under provisions of the Code if we undergo an ownership change after our IPO (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period). We also inherited net operating losses, or NOLs, from the acquisition of Datawatch and Univa, which are subject to specific limitations on usage. We may also be unable to realize our tax credit carryforwards which began to expire in 2018.\nBased on the evidence available, including a lack of taxable earnings in the United States, we recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in the United States. If a change in judgment regarding this valuation allowance were to occur in the future, we will record a potentially material deferred tax benefit, which could result in a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in that period. The utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduces the amount of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.\nThe Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The impact of GILTI resulted in no incremental tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a full valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets. We have made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. In addition, the recently enacted CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) provide relief to U.S. federal corporate taxpayers through temporary adjustments to net operating loss rules, changes to limitations on interest expense deductibility, and the acceleration of available refunds for minimum tax credit carryforwards. The CARES Act and the CAA did not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations and certain financial data for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(1)\nBillings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions. For more information about Billings and our other non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d contained herein.\n(2)\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and our other non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d contained herein.\n(3)\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d contained herein.\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $62.3 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSoftware\nThe 16% increase in our software revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily the result of growth across all three geographic regions, and supported by increases in new and expansion business, as well as retention in our renewal base.\nSoftware related services\nSoftware related services revenue increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in customer demand for these services as businesses begin to recover from effects of COVID-19.\nClient engineering services\nCES revenue decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily a result of our CES customers response to COVID-19, including furloughed staff positions and reduced CES staff working hours.\nOther\nOther revenue remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of revenue\nSoftware\nCost of software revenue increased $9.5 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Employee compensation and related expense increased $3.4 million, primarily due to increased headcount and compensation in the current year. Employee compensation was lower in the prior year as a result of temporary compensation reductions made in the second and third quarters of 2020. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.2 million, third-party consulting fees increased $0.9 million, and we incurred $1.0 million of restructuring expense in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSoftware related services\nCost of software related services revenue increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by the increase in revenue, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the current year expense was primarily attributable to increased employee compensation of $2.0 million. Employee compensation was lower in the prior year as a result of temporary compensation reductions made in the second and third quarters of 2020.\nClient engineering services\nCost of CES revenue decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, consistent with the change in CES revenue. We have managed CES headcount and compensation to match our customers\u2019 demand for our staffing resources, and therefore our costs have moved accordingly.\nOther\nThe cost of other revenue increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is related to inventory obsolescence, product costs and shipping fees.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $53.9 million, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in software revenue combined with a relatively smaller increase in cost of revenue.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses, as discussed below, support all the products and services that we provide to our customers and, as a result, they are reported and discussed in the aggregate.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased $25.0 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Employee compensation and related expense increased $14.6 million, primarily due to increased headcount and compensation in the current year. Employee compensation was lower in the prior year as a result of temporary compensation reductions made in the second and third quarters of 2020. Stock-based compensation expense and cloud hosting expense increased $8.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and we incurred $1.7 million of restructuring expense in the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset a decrease in consulting fees of $1.0 million.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $21.3 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Employee compensation and related expense increased $11.0 million, primarily due to increased headcount and compensation in the current year. Employee compensation was lower in the prior year as a result of temporary compensation reductions made in the second and third quarters of 2020. Stock-based compensation expense increased $8.6 million, and we incurred $1.8 million of restructuring expense in the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and marketing expense of $0.8 million from suspension or reductions of certain in-person sales and marketing activities as a result of COVID-19.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $5.1 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.2 million, and employee compensation and related expense increased $1.2 million, primarily due to increased headcount and compensation in the current year. Employee compensation was lower in the prior year as a result of temporary compensation reductions made in the second and third quarters of 2020. Travel expense and facilities costs increased $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and we incurred $0.5 million of restructuring expense in the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in cloud hosting expense in the current year.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily attributable to an increase in intangible assets resulting from acquisitions in the current year and in late 2020.\nOther operating income, net\nOther operating income, net was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision for credit losses decreased $0.7 million in the current year, while the prior year period includes a $1.0 million gain recognized from settlements related to a historical acquisition.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of an increase in the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes.\nOther expense (income), net\nOther expense, net was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.9 million of other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily a result of $1.9 million in losses from foreign currency fluctuations in the United States dollar relative to other functional currencies during the year ended December 31, 2021, and a $0.6 million decrease in interest income in the current year due to lower interest rates as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome tax expense\nThe effective tax rate was (2,953%) and 617% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The tax rate is affected by the Company being a U.S. resident taxpayer, the tax rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no benefit or expense is recognized due to a valuation allowance. The effective tax rate was impacted by the geographic income mix in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily related to a United States pre-tax loss of $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, for which a tax benefit was not recognized due to the valuation allowance, compared to a United States pre-tax loss of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, for which a tax benefit was not recognized due to the valuation allowance. Income tax expense also includes taxes withheld outside of the United States attributable to remittances to the Company from certain foreign subsidiaries for which offsetting tax credits are not recognizable due to valuation allowance considerations.\nNet loss\nNet loss decreased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related expense, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring charges and a decrease in income tax expense in the current year, as described above.\nFor information regarding the comparison of results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nWe monitor the following key non-GAAP (United States generally accepted accounting principles) financial and operating metrics to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In analyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including Billings as a liquidity measure, Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure.\nBillings. Billings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions during the period. Given that we generally bill our customers at the time of sale but typically recognize a portion of the related revenue ratably over time, management believes that Billings is a meaningful way to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers.\nBillings increased by $59.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in Billings was attributable to an increase in Software segment billings.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly utilized by us and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $28.0 million, or 49%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nFree Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful in analyzing our ability to service and repay debt, when applicable, and return value directly to stockholders.\nFree Cash Flow increased by $27.0 million, or 101%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in Free Cash Flow was primarily attributable to an increase in our cash-related profitability for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures included in the tables below, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and are by definition an incomplete understanding of the Company and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures.\nWe believe that the non-GAAP measures disclosed herein are only useful as an additional tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about our financial and operating performance and liquidity. By definition, non-GAAP measures do not give a full understanding of the Company. To be truly valuable, they must be used in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. It may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies\u2019 non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of revenue to Billings, net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, and net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nBillings\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(1)\nIncluded for the year ended December 31, 2021, is $1.2 million currency gains on acquisition-related intercompany loans. Included for the year ended December 31, 2020, are $1.0 million of proceeds from settlements related to an historical acquisition and $0.6 million of severance expense. Included for the year ended December 31, 2019, are acquisition-related costs of $0.6 million, severance expenses of $0.4 million and impairment charges for royalty contracts of $1.0 million.\nFree Cash Flow\nRecurring Software License Rate. A key factor to our success is our recurring software license rate which we measure through billings, primarily derived from annual renewals of our existing subscription customer agreements. We calculate our recurring software license rate for a particular period by dividing (i) the sum of software term-based license billings, software license maintenance billings, and 20% of software perpetual license billings which we believe approximates maintenance as an element of the arrangement by (ii) the total software license, including all term-based subscriptions, maintenance and perpetual license billings from all customers for that period. Our recurring software license rate was 92% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and 87% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were $413.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $150.0 million availability on our credit facility. We have outstanding debt in the form of convertible senior notes with a $230.0 million principal amount as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Other accrued expenses and current liabilities includes a balance payable on an existing legal judgment against World Programming. We paid this judgment in January 2022, for $65.9 million.\nFor more than twenty trading days during thirty consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2021, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the convertible senior notes. As a result, the convertible senior notes were convertible at the option of the holders, and the $199.7 million carrying amount of the convertible senior notes remains classified as a short-term liability as of December 31, 2021. We have the ability to settle the convertible notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election.\nWe continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions designed to expand our business. As a result, our expected uses of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced, or we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions.\nWe own an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to our headquarters, which we may develop over the next few years. We have not yet determined the nature and scope of the overall timeline and investment beyond the immediate rezoning efforts necessary for our potential use in the future.\nOur existing cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate during fiscal 2022, due to changes in our planned cash expenditures, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19 and global unrest. It is possible that certain customers may unilaterally decide to extend payments on accounts receivable, however the Company\u2019s customer base is comprised primarily of larger organizations with typically strong liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe that our existing cash balances, together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements for the next twelve months. We also believe that our financial resources, along with managing discretionary expenses, will allow us to manage the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future and withstand global unrest, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. We will continue to evaluate our financial position as developments evolve relating to COVID-19 and global unrest.\nPrivate placement financing\nIn September 2021, the Company issued 2,935,564 shares of its Class A common stock in a private placement to Matrix Capital Management Company LP, for aggregate proceeds of $200.0 million. Per the terms of the agreement, the shares are subject to a one-year lockup period. The Company expects to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nRevolving credit facility\nWe have a $150.0 million credit facility that was amended on June 5, 2019, to permit the issuance of the Convertible Notes and extend the maturity date of the credit facility to December 15, 2023 (\u201c2019 Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement allows us to request that the aggregate commitments under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement be increased by up to $50.0 million for a total of $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement and there was $150.0 million available for future borrowing. The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions.\nThe 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is secured by collateral including (i) substantially all of our properties and assets, and the properties and assets of our domestic subsidiaries but excluding any patents, copyrights, patent applications or copyright applications or any trade secrets or software products and (ii) pledges of the equity interests in all present and future domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions as provided for under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement). Our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of all of the obligations under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants which require, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, the maintenance of a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 a maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum net Leverage Ratio of 5.0 to 1.0, as such terms are defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. For additional information about the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 7 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash flows\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we had an aggregate of cash and cash equivalents of $413.7 million and $241.2 million, which we held for working capital purposes, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, $348.0 million and $187.9 million of this aggregate amount was held in the United States, and $60.2 million and $45.7 million was held in the APAC and EMEA regions with the remainder held in Canada, Mexico, and South America.\nOther than statutory limitations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Altair. Based on our current liquidity needs and repatriation strategies, we expect that we can manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n_____________________________\n(1)\nFor information regarding a comparison of net cash provided/used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $61.6 million, which reflects an increase of $28.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was the result of changes to our working capital position for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $62.5 million, which reflects an increase of $13.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in net cash payments of $13.0 million for business acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $175.9 million, which reflects an increase in cash provided of $144.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 2,935,564 shares of our Class A common stock in a private placement for aggregate net proceeds of $200.0 million and we made a $30.0 million payment on our revolving credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had cash borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $30.0 million.\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nThere were adverse effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to favorable effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock repurchase program\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock. As permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors, purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices, or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company intends to use the share repurchase plan to opportunistically return capital to shareholders while still focusing on its primary goal of investing in the business to drive growth.\nThe authorization provides that: (1) the new stock repurchase program shall continue until the earlier of the date an aggregate of $50.0 million of common stock has been repurchased , or until suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion; and (2) all shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the new program shall be retired and be available for use and reissuance for purposes as and when determined by the Board of Directors including, without limitation, pursuant to the Company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company\u2019s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nCommitments\nOur principal commitments as of December 31, 2021, consist of our $230.0 million Convertible Notes due in 2024.\nFor more than twenty trading days during thirty consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2021, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the convertible senior notes. As a result, the convertible senior notes were convertible at the option of the holders, and the $199.7 million carrying amount of the convertible senior notes remains classified as a short-term liability as of December 31, 2021. We have the ability to settle the convertible notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. Conversion of the notes by noteholders may cause dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, there have been no requests for conversion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was a balance payable on an existing legal judgment against World Programming. We paid this judgment in January 2022, for $65.9 million. Additionally, we have recorded a $20.3 million liability as part of the acquisition consideration of World Programming that is contingent upon the results of certain legal matters and will be settled in the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a net benefit liability of $15.7 million associated with our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. For additional information on pension and other post-retirement benefits, including expected benefit payments for the next 10 years, see Note 14 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have non-cancelable contractual agreements primarily related to the hosting of our data storage processing, storage, and other computing services, as well as other commitments. We had $26.4 million in commitments, as of December 31, 2021, primarily due within three years.\nWe also have approximately $17.3 million of tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts. For additional discussion of uncertain tax positions, see Note 12 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical accounting estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting estimates discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these estimates relate to the more significant areas involving management\u2019s judgments and assumptions. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\nRevenue recognition\nWe generate revenue from our Software and CES segments and our other businesses. Revenue is recognized by identifying a contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSoftware\nSoftware revenue includes product revenue from software product licensing arrangements, related services consisting of software maintenance and support in the form of post-contract customer support (PCS or maintenance) and professional services such as consulting and training services. Software products are sold to customers primarily under a term-based software licensing model and to a lesser degree, perpetual software licenses. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.\nMost term-based software license agreements include our patented units-based subscription model which allows customers to license a pool of units for their organizations, providing individual users flexible access to our portfolio of engineering software applications as well as to our growing portfolio of partner products. The amount of software usage is limited by the number of the units licensed by the customer. Revenue from these arrangements is fixed (based on the units licensed) and is not based on actual customer usage of each software product.\nRevenue from term-based software licenses is classified as license software revenue. Term-based licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and PCS, which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Maximizing the use of observable inputs, we determined that a majority of the estimated standalone selling price of the term-based license is attributable to the term license and a minority is attributable to the PCS. The license component is recognized as revenue upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. The PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we provide the PCS benefit over time.\nIn addition to term-based software licenses, we sell perpetual licenses. Typically, our perpetual licenses are sold with PCS, which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Revenue from the software component is classified as license software revenue and is recognized upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. We allocate values in bundled perpetual and PCS arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and PCS. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation over time.\nRevenue from training, consulting and other services is recognized as the services are performed. For contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation, such as providing a training class to a customer, we recognize revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. For service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations (for example, both training and consulting), we measure the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognize revenue accordingly. In measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations, we typically utilize output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimate output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. Input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.\nWe also execute arrangements through indirect channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users of our products and services in specified territories. In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner generally bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and term-based licenses. Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to us by the channel partners. This amount includes a fee for PCS that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is recognized over the period that PCS is to be provided. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners.\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, for each performance obligation within each contract. The SSP is the price that we would sell a promised service separately to one of our customers. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We estimate SSP using information such as past transactions, internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other information reasonably available to us.\nNon-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable, net and other accrued expenses and current liabilities. These amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations and do not impact reported revenues or expenses. Certain hardware revenue is included within software revenue and is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria stated above are met, which is generally when the products are delivered to end customers.\nSoftware related services\nConsulting services from product design and development projects are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a time-and-materials, or T&M, or fixed-price basis. Altair recognizes services revenue from our T&M contracts using\ninput-based estimates, utilizing direct labor and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates as the input measure. For fixed-price contracts, software services revenue is recognized over time using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, generally using a cost-input method where revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total cost incurred to estimated total costs at completion. If output or input measures are not available or cannot be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon completion of the services.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration of acquired businesses to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe determine the estimated fair values using information available to us and engage independent third-party valuation specialists when necessary. We generally use an income approach to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired. Estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expenses to operate the acquired business, and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nIncome taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets can result from unused operating losses, research and development credits, foreign tax credit carryforwards, and deductions recorded for financial statement purposes prior to them being deductible on a tax return. Valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences. We consider, among other available information, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, limitations on the availability of tax credit carryforwards, and other evidence assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance are included in the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period they become known or can be estimated.\nThe valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets may be recoverable. Historically, we have had substantial United States tax credit carryforwards which began to expire in 2018. The ability to utilize these DTAs is highly dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in the United States in the future.\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to our accounting for tax uncertainties. We review all of our tax positions and make determinations as to whether our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Only those benefits, or exposures, that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities are recognized. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting guidance and the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 of the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk associated with our debt.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs a result of our substantial international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including in connection with our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, we translate sales and financial results denominated in foreign currencies into United States dollars for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenue and operating income while depreciation of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenue and operating income.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we do not have any foreign currency hedging contracts, since exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows. Based on our current international operations, we do not plan on engaging in hedging activities in the near future.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Risk\nIn June 2019, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.250% Convertible Notes. Our Convertible Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.250% and, therefore, we do not have interest rate exposure on our Convertible Notes. However, the value of the Convertible Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Convertible Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the Convertible Notes are affected by our stock price. The fair value of the Convertible Notes will generally increase as our Class A common stock price increases in value and will generally decrease as our Class A common stock price declines in value. Additionally, we carry the Convertible Notes at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $413.7 million and $241.5 million, respectively, consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. Such interest-bearing instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations of interest expense have not been significant.\nInterest rate risk relates to the gain/increase or loss/decrease we could incur on our debt balances and interest expense associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income we realize on our invested cash balances. It is our policy not to enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes, and therefore, we hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes.",

Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in periodic reports filed with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) as of December 31, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021.\n(b) Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria established by Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Accordingly, we have excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting of World Programming Limited, December 2015 Software Limited and S-FRAME Software Inc., which are included in our December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements and constituted 1% and (16)% of total and net assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets), respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of revenues for the year then ended. We have excluded all current year acquisitions from our annual assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on the evaluation under these frameworks, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The results of management\u2019s assessment have been reviewed with the Audit Committee.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSoftware Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 3, the Company\u2019s software contracts with customers typically include a promise to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgement is required to allocate the transaction price to each of these performance obligations. The Company\u2019s determination of standalone selling price for performance obligations is based on the midpoint of the range of historical observable prices for goods and services sold separately. In addition, the Company estimates the standalone selling price for certain performance obligations where observable prices are not directly available or a significant portion of historical prices are not within the range. The Company estimates the standalone selling price for each performance obligation at contract inception considering all information that is reasonably available and based on the amount of consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s estimate of the standalone selling prices in software contracts was challenging and complex due to the Company\u2019s wide range of observable prices from goods or services sold separately and the estimation used for certain performance obligations where observable prices are not available.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's process and controls to establish and monitor the relative standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation in software contracts.\nTo test the estimated standalone selling prices, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions used by the Company to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation in software contracts. For example, we evaluated the methodology used to determine the standalone selling price by testing a historical analysis prepared by the Company and practices observed in the industry. We also tested the data used in the analysis and recalculated the standalone selling prices.\nBusiness Combination\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 4, the Company completed the acquisition of World Programming Limited and December 2015 Software Limited for consideration of $70.3 million. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s acquisition of World Programming Ltd. was challenging and complex due to significant estimation uncertainty in certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration. The intangible assets acquired primarily consisted of developed technology of $30.5 million and customer relationships of $8.0 million. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the identified intangible assets included future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expenses to operate the acquired business, and discount rates. The significant assumption used to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration consisted of the Company\u2019s assessment of certain legal proceedings.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its accounting for acquisitions. For example, we tested controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of the identified intangible assets and contingent consideration, including management\u2019s evaluation of the significant assumptions. In addition, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the valuation calculation performed by its specialist, including management\u2019s procedures to validate the discount rates selected and methods used.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the identified intangible assets, our audit procedures included evaluating the Company's selected valuation methodology and testing the significant assumptions used in the model. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology and significant assumptions used to determine the fair value estimates, including discount rates used by the Company. We also performed procedures to test the assumptions used to develop the forecasted data used in the model. For example, we compared revenue growth rates to historical results of the acquired business, to third-party market data, to peer companies within the same industry, and to other acquisitions completed by the Company in the past. We compared expenses required to operate the acquired business as a percentage of revenue to historical results of the acquired company, and to other acquisitions completed by the Company in the past. To test the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, our audit procedures included inquiries with internal counsel to gain an understanding of the status of the legal proceedings, reviewing letters addressing the proceedings from internal and external counsel, obtaining representations from management on the proceedings, and evaluating the Company\u2019s disclosures.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2015.\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 28, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Altair Engineering Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Altair Engineering Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Altair Engineering Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of World Programming Limited, December 2015 Software Limited and S-FRAME Software, Inc., which are included in the December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 1% and (16)% of total and net assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets), respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and less than 1% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of all current year acquisitions.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 28, 2022\nALTAIR ENGINEERING INC.

Summary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Third-party holdings of equity interests in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries that are less than controlled represent noncontrolling interests. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its significant estimates including the stand alone selling price, or SSP, for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the incremental borrowing rate used in the valuation of lease liabilities, fair value of convertible senior notes, provision for doubtful accounts, tax valuation allowances, liabilities for uncertain tax provisions, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, retirement obligations, useful lives of intangible assets, revenue for fixed price contracts, valuation of common stock, and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign currency translation\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Equity balances and transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAll assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with gains and losses recognized in foreign currency losses, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has no transactions which hedge purchase commitments and no intercompany balances which are designated as being of a long-term investment in nature.\nRevenue recognition\nSoftware revenue\nRevenue is derived principally from the licensing of software products and from related maintenance contracts. The Company enters into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.\nRevenue from term-based software licenses is classified as software revenue. Term-based licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term-based software license and post-contract customer support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Maximizing the use of observable inputs, the Company determined that a majority of the estimated standalone selling prices of the term-based license is attributable to the term-based license and a minority is attributable to the PCS. The license component is classified as license revenue and recognized as revenue upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. PCS is classified as maintenance and other services and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as the Company provides the PCS benefit over time as a stand ready to perform obligation.\nIn addition to term-based software licenses, the Company sells perpetual licenses. Software revenue is recognized upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. Typically, the Company\u2019s perpetual licenses are sold with PCS. The Company allocates value in bundled perpetual and PCS arrangements based on the value relationship between the software license and maintenance. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance and other services and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as the Company satisfies the PCS performance obligation over time as a stand ready to perform obligation.\nRevenue from training, consulting and other services is recognized as the services are performed, and is classified as maintenance and other services in the consolidated statement of operations. For contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation, such as providing a training class to a customer, the Company recognizes revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. For service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations (for example, point-in-time training and consulting), the Company measures the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognizes revenue accordingly. In measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations, the Company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with fixed fee arrangements, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each contract. Input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.\nThe Company also executes arrangements through indirect channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the Company's software products to end users of the Company's products and services in specified territories. In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. The Company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and term-based licenses. Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the Company by the channel partners. This amount includes a fee for PCS that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is recognized over the period that PCS is to be provided. The Company does not offer right of return, product rotation, or price protection to any of its channel partners.\nNon-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable, net and other accrued expenses and current liabilities. These amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations and do not impact reported revenues or expenses. Certain hardware revenue is included within software revenue and is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria stated above are met, which is generally when the products are delivered to end customers.\nSoftware related services\nConsulting services from product design and development projects are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a time-and-materials (\u201cT&M\u201d) or fixed-price basis. The Company recognizes software services revenue for T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates using the input method. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the output method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated project costs.\nClient engineering services\nClient engineering services revenue are derived from professional services for staffing primarily representing engineers and data scientists located at a customer site. These professional services are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a T&M basis. The Company recognizes this revenue for T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates using the input method.\nOther\nOther revenue includes product revenue from the sale of LED products primarily for the replacement of fluorescent tubes. Revenue from the sale of LED products is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria stated above are met, which is generally when the products are delivered to resellers or to end customers. Sales returns, which reduce revenue, are estimated using historical experience.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments less accumulated amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period incurred. Major expenditures for betterments are capitalized when they meet the criteria for capitalization. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.\nBuilding and improvements is depreciated over an estimated useful life of five to thirty-nine years. Computer equipment and software is depreciated over an estimated useful life of three to five years. Office furniture and equipment is depreciated over an estimated useful life of five to fifteen years. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized over the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset or improvement, whichever is shorter.\nSoftware development costs\nSoftware development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a detailed program design. Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends when the product is available for general release. Generally, the time between the establishment of technological feasibility and commercial release of software is short. As such, all internal software development costs have been expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, including developed technology and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company compares the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and third-party independent appraisals. No impairment losses were recognized in 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired entity over the estimated fair values of the net tangible assets and the identifiable assets acquired. As described in Note 4 - Acquisitions, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with certain acquisitions. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nThe Company has determined that there is one reporting unit with goodwill subject to goodwill impairment testing. An entity has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the quantitative two-step impairment test.\nThe Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the\nquantitative two-step impairment test. The qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nThe impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment dates. For 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit with goodwill was less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company determined that its goodwill was not impaired.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangibles in the fourth quarter of each year and when a triggering event occurs between annual reporting dates. In 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived trade names and determined there was no indication of impairment. Accordingly, no impairment charges were recognized in 2021 .\nReceivable for R&D credit\nThe French government provides a research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) tax credit known as Credit Imp\u00f4t Recherche, or CIR, in order to encourage Companies to invest in R&D. The tax credit is deductible from the French income tax and any excess is carried forward for three years. After three years, any unused credit may be reimbursed to the Company by the French government. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $12.0 million receivables from the French government related to CIR, of which $3.5 million is recorded in income tax receivable and the remaining $8.5 million is recorded in other long-term assets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $13.2 million receivables from the French government related to CIR, of which $3.2 million was recorded in income tax receivable and the remaining $10.0 million was recorded in other long-term assets. CIR is subject to customary audit by the French tax authorities.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that these assets will more likely than not be realized. These deferred tax assets are subject to periodic assessments as to recoverability and if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized, valuation allowances are recorded which increase the provision for income taxes. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing and reversal of existing temporary differences, ability to carryback losses, and tax planning strategies. If based upon the evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to its accounting for tax uncertainties. The Company reviews all of its tax positions and makes determinations as to whether its tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Only those benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities are recognized. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of research and development employees and costs incurred related to the development of new software products and significant enhancements and engineering changes to existing software products.\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $4.3 million, $4.0 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMezzanine equity\nIn 2017, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Class A common stock to a third-party as partial consideration for the purchase of developed technology. These shares have a put right that can be exercised by the holder five years from date of purchase at $12.50 per share that requires the shares to be recorded at fair value and classified as mezzanine equity in the consolidated balance sheet. The put right option is terminated if the shareholders sell their shares. As of December 31, 2017, the Company concluded that it is no longer probable that the put option will be exercised as the put value is substantially below market value and subsequent adjustment is not required.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the third-party holder sold 133,336 shares on the open market and as a result, the issuance value of those shares was reclassified into permanent equity from mezzanine equity. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining 66,664 shares continue to be classified as mezzanine equity until one of the following three events take place: (1) the shares are sold on the open market; (2) a redemption feature lapses; or (3) there is a modification of the terms of the instrument.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not receive any lease concessions related to COVID-19 that had a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nStock-based compensation\nEmployee stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares expected to be settled by issuing shares of Class A common stock, are recorded as equity awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP shares on the date of grant is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company expenses the grant date fair value of its time-vested stock options subject to graded vesting using the straight-line method over the applicable service period. The Company expenses the fair value of ESPP shares over the offering period. The fair value of RSUs is measured using the fair value of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of RSUs is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of purchase consideration of the acquired businesses is allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent accounting guidance\nAccounting standards adopted\nIncome Taxes - In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles for income taxes. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective as of January 1, 2021, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations - In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on prospective basis, effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting standards not yet adopted\nReference Rate Reform - In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04. Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another rate that is expected to be discontinued. The amendments in the guidance are optional and effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nDebt - In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating certain separation models. Under ASU 2020-06, a convertible debt instrument will generally be reported as a single liability at its amortized cost with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The update also requires the if-converted method to be used for convertible instruments and the effect of potential share settlement be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance allows entities to use a modified or full retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 and is currently evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and earnings per share attributable to common stockholders.\n3. Revenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue recognition\nSoftware revenue\nRevenue is derived principally from the licensing of software products and from related maintenance contracts. The Company enters into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.\nRevenue from term-based software licenses is classified as software revenue. Term-based licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term-based software license and post-contract customer support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Maximizing the use of observable inputs, the Company determined that a majority of the estimated standalone selling prices of the term-based license is attributable to the term-based license and a minority is attributable to the PCS. The license component is classified as license revenue and recognized as revenue upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. PCS is classified as maintenance and other services and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as the Company provides the PCS benefit over time as a stand ready to perform obligation.\nIn addition to term-based software licenses, the Company sells perpetual licenses. Software revenue is recognized upon the later of delivery of the licensed product or the beginning of the license period. Typically, the Company\u2019s perpetual licenses are sold with PCS. The Company allocates value in bundled perpetual and PCS arrangements based on the value relationship between the software license and maintenance. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance and other services and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as the Company satisfies the PCS performance obligation over time as a stand ready to perform obligation.\nRevenue from training, consulting and other services is recognized as the services are performed, and is classified as maintenance and other services in the consolidated statement of operations. For contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation, such as providing a training class to a customer, the Company recognizes revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. For service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations (for example, point-in-time training and consulting), the Company measures the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognizes revenue accordingly. In measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations, the Company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with fixed fee arrangements, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each contract. Input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.\nThe Company also executes arrangements through indirect channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the Company's software products to end users of the Company's products and services in specified territories. In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. The Company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and term-based licenses. Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the Company by the channel partners. This amount includes a fee for PCS that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is recognized over the period that PCS is to be provided. The Company does not offer right of return, product rotation, or price protection to any of its channel partners.\nNon-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable, net and other accrued expenses and current liabilities. These amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations and do not impact reported revenues or expenses. Certain hardware revenue is included within software revenue and is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria stated above are met, which is generally when the products are delivered to end customers.\nSoftware related services revenue\nConsulting services from product design and development projects are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a time-and-materials (\u201cT&M\u201d) or fixed-price basis. The Company recognizes software services revenue for T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates using the input method. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the output method based on the ratio of costs incurred, to the total estimated project costs.\nClient engineering services and Other revenue\nClient engineering services revenue are derived from professional services for staffing primarily representing engineers and data scientists located at a customer site. These professional services are considered distinct performance obligations and are provided to customers on a T&M basis. The Company recognizes this revenue for T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually greed upon hourly rates using the input method. No significant judgments were made for revenue recognition within Other revenue.\nSignificant judgments\nSoftware revenue\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations within the context of the arrangement, and if so, the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. The Company\u2019s determination of standalone selling price for performance obligations is based on the midpoint of the range of historical observable prices for goods and services sold separately. In addition, the Company estimates the standalone selling price for certain performance obligations where observable prices are not directly available, or a significant portion of historical prices are not within the range. In instances where standalone selling price was not determined based on the range of historical observable prices for goods and services sold separately, the Company used an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the standalone selling price. In such cases the Company has considered market conditions and other observable inputs, such as internal price lists, peer data, and industry data for a similar or identical product. The Company estimates standalone selling price at contract inception considering all information that is reasonably available and is based on the amount of consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price. Payment terms vary by contract type; however, arrangements typically stipulate a requirement for the customer to pay within 30 to 60 days.\nThe Company rarely enters into agreements to modify previously executed contracts, which constitute contract modifications. The Company assesses each of these contract modifications to determine (i) if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement; and (ii) if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances. A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either (i) a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract\u037e or (ii) a cumulative catch-up basis. Generally, the Company\u2019s contract modifications meet both criteria and are accounted for as a separate contract, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue by type of performance obligation and timing of revenue recognition as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nTerm licenses and other includes hardware revenue of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and was reported in License revenue. Professional software services includes hardware revenue of $10 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was reported in Maintenance and other services revenue.\nThe Company derived approximately 12.0%, 11.2% and 9.8% of its total revenue through indirect sales channels for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCosts to obtain a contract\nThe Company pays commissions for new software product and PCS sales as well as for renewals of existing software and PCS contracts. Commissions paid to obtain renewal contracts are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new product sales and therefore, a portion of the commissions paid for new contracts relate to future renewals.\nThe Company accounts for new product sales commissions using a portfolio approach and allocates the cost of commissions in proportion to the allocation of the transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions allocated to the license and license renewal components are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of four years, reflecting the Company\u2019s estimate of the expected period that it will benefit from those commissions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $4.5 million and $3.7 million recorded in Prepaid and other current assets and $0.4 million and $0.6 million recorded in Other long-term assets. Sales commissions were $7.3 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were included in sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations.\nContract assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, contract assets were $3.8 million included in Accounts receivable and $2.3 million included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2020, contract assets were $6.7 million included in Accounts receivable, $1.4 million included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $1.3 million included in Other long-term assets.\nDeferred revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license, PCS and professional services agreements. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of billings to customers. Payment terms vary by the type and location of customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. The Company generally invoices its customers annually for the forthcoming year of software licenses, and more frequently for other products and services. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s deferred revenue balance does not include revenue for future years of multiple year non-cancellable contracts that have not yet been billed.\nApproximately $78.0 million of revenue recognized during 2021 was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the year.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted revenue not yet recognized was $146.4 million and $131.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Of the amount recorded as of December 31, 2021, the Company expects to recognize approximately 80% over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\n4. Acquisitions\nWorld Programming\nIn December 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of two related privately held companies, World Programming Limited and December 2015 Software Limited (together \u201cWorld Programming\u201d), from the stockholders named therein, for preliminary aggregate consideration of $70.3 million. The closing consideration of $70.3 million consisted of cash in the amount of $50.0 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment and an aggregate of $20.3 million of contingent consideration, consisting of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock (the \u201cStock Consideration\u201d). The dates on which the Stock Consideration is issuable and the number of shares issuable on such dates depend primarily on certain aspects of legal proceedings in which World Programming and SAS Institute, Inc. are engaged. For further information on the legal proceedings see Note 16.\nIn addition, per the stock purchase agreement, $29.5 million worth of Class A Common Stock will be issued subject to the continuing employment of certain key employees and are not reflected in aggregate consideration but will be recognized as stock-based compensation over the employment period. For further information on the stock-based compensation see Note 11.\nWorld Programming is an enterprise software company based in the UK with a global customer base and focused on data analytics for financial services, insurance, manufacturing, life sciences, energy, consumer products, and retail applications. World Programming\u2019s platform supports development and execution of multi-language software solutions leveraging popular languages used in data science including Python, R, and the SAS language in a single program.\nThe Company expects this acquisition to be accretive to its software business, broaden its market opportunities, and contribute to long-term growth goals.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which results in acquired assets and assumed liabilities being measured at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase consideration transferred to acquire World Programming and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):\n(1)\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to market synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. All goodwill is recorded in the Software segment.\nThe preliminary estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and identifiable intangible assets may be subject to change as additional information is received. The valuation was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair value of intangible assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, contingent consideration, income taxes and residual goodwill.

Debt\nConvertible senior notes\nIn June 2019, the Company issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2024 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), which includes the underwriters\u2019 exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional $30.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes, in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were $221.9 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs.\nThe Company entered into a First Supplemental Indenture relating to the issuance by the Company of the Convertible Notes (the \u201cSupplemental Indenture\u201d) supplementing the Indenture, dated June 10, 2019 (the \u201cBase Indenture,\u201d and together with the Supplemental Indenture, the \u201cIndenture\u201d), by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the Convertible Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the Convertible Notes become automatically due and payable. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.\nThe Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2019. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 1, 2024, unless, earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.\nThe Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 21.5049 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $46.50 per share of its Class A common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Indenture but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make whole fundamental change or a redemption period (each as defined in the Indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a specified number of additional shares for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on December 1, 2023, in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022\nDuring any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022\nDuring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n\u2022\nIf the Company calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption (which the Company may not do prior to June 6, 2022), at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or\n\u2022\nUpon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after December 1, 2023 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A Common Stock, at the Company\u2019s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. The Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash and the conversion spread in shares.\nFor more than twenty trading days during the thirty consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2021, the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes. As a result, the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders and remained classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As of the date of this filing, none of the holders of the Convertible Notes have submitted requests for conversion.\nThe Company may settle the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A Common Stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash and the conversion spread in shares. As of December 31, 2021, the \u201cif-converted value\u201d exceeded the principal amount of the Convertible Notes by $111.1 million.\nThe Company accounts for the Convertible Notes as separate liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component of the Convertible Notes was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar debt instruments that did not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, or the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The $51.8 million difference between the gross proceeds received from issuance of the Convertible Notes of $230.0 million and the estimated fair value of the liability component of $178.2 million, represents the equity component that was recorded in additional paid-in capital. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nThe Company allocated issuance costs related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the initial carrying value of the Convertible Notes. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component are included with the equity component in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe net carrying value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes was as follows (in thousands):\nThe net carrying value of the equity component of the Convertible Notes was $50.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe interest expense related to the Convertible Notes was as follows (in thousands):\nCredit agreement\nRevolving credit facility\nThe Company has a $150.0 million credit agreement with a maturity date of December 15, 2023 (\u201c2019 Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement provides for an accordion feature that allows the Company to expand the size of the revolving line of credit by an additional $50.0 million, subject to certain conditions, by obtaining additional commitments from the existing lenders or by causing a person acceptable to the administrative agent to become a lender (in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement).\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement and there was $150.0 million available for future borrowing at that time. In January 2021, the Company repaid the $30.0 million borrowing outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, and permitted acquisitions.\nBorrowings under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an agreed upon applicable margin plus, at the Company\u2019s option, either the Alternate Base Rate (defined as the greatest of (1) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% or (3) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00%) or the Adjusted LIBO Rate. The applicable margin for borrowings under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is based on the Company\u2019s most recently tested consolidated total net leverage ratio and will vary from (a) in the case of Eurodollar loans, 1.25% to 2.00%, and (b) in the case of ABR loans or swingline loans, 0.25% to 1.00%. The Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% on the unused portion of the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement was 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCollateral and guarantees\nThe 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is secured by collateral including (i) substantially all of the Company\u2019s properties and assets, and the properties and assets of the Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries but excluding any patents, copyrights, patent applications or copyright applications or any trade secrets or software products and (ii) pledges of the equity interests in all present and future domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions as provided for under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement). The Company\u2019s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of all the obligations under the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement.\nDebt covenants\nThe 2019 Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain the following financial covenants:\n\u2022\nMaximum Net Leverage Ratio : On the last day of each fiscal quarter, the Company on a consolidated basis will not permit the ratio of total indebtedness (net of unrestricted domestic cash in excess of $20.0 million) to EBITDA, as such terms are defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, for the rolling four quarter period ending on such date to be greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\n\u2022\nSenior Secured Leverage Ratio : On the last day of each fiscal quarter, the Company on a consolidated basis will not permit the ratio of total indebtedness secured by a lien (net of unrestricted domestic cash in excess of $20.0 million) to EBITDA, as such terms are defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, for the rolling four quarter period ending on such date to be greater than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\n\u2022\nConsolidated Interest Coverage Ratio : On the last day of each fiscal quarter, the Company on a consolidated basis will not permit the ratio of (x) EBITDA to (y) cash Consolidated Interest Expense, as such terms are defined in the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, in each case for the rolling four quarter period ending on such date, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of the above financial covenants.\nOther\nThe Company has available overdraft and line of credit facilities in several countries in which it operates. These credit facilities are with various domestic and international banks and are at quoted market rates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $3.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of availability under these facilities and there were no outstanding commitments.\n8. Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets and operating lease obligations on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRight of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. At commencement date, the ROU asset also includes adjustments for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs, if applicable. As most of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using rates specific to the term of the lease, economic environments where lease activity is concentrated, value of lease portfolio, and assuming full collateralization of the loans. Subsequent to the commencement date, the operating ROU asset is equal to the remeasured lease liability adjusted for cumulative prepaid or accrued rent if the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term, unamortized lease incentives, unamortized initial direct costs and any impairment of the ROU assets. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease cost for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company does not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for short-term leases (leases with a term of twelve months or less). For contracts with lease and non-lease components, the Company does not allocate the contract consideration, and accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nThe Company\u2019s operating leases consist of office facilities, office equipment and cars and the Company\u2019s finance leases consist of office equipment and cars. The Company\u2019s leases have remaining terms of less than one year to 6.7 years, some of which include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms up to six years and some of which include options to terminate the leases within the next three years.\nThe components of lease cost were as follows (in thousands):\nOperating lease cost includes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial. Rent cost related to operating leases for office facilities was $12.2 million, $12.1 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to lease liabilities was as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021, were as follows (in thousands):\n9. Fair value measurements\nThe accounting guidance for fair value, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The framework for measuring fair value consists of a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions made by the reporting entity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:\nLevel 1-\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2-\nObservable inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3-\nUnobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAn asset\u2019s or liability\u2019s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Interest on the Company\u2019s line of credit is at a variable rate, and as such the debt obligation outstanding approximates fair value.\nThe carrying value of the Company\u2019s Convertible Notes are at face value less unamortized debt discount and issuance costs. The estimated fair values of the Convertible Notes, which the Company has classified as Level 2 financial instruments, were determined based on quoted bid prices of the Convertible Notes on the last trading day of each reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Convertible Notes was $392.1 million and is presented for required disclosure purposes only. For further information on the Convertible Notes see Note 7.\nThe Company is exposed to certain financial market risks related to its ongoing business operations. The Company can manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through derivative financial instruments and hedging activities. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities can be utilized to protect the Company\u2019s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and to manage interest costs. Although the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the derivative financial instruments, the Company attempts to limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with major financial institutions that meet the Company\u2019s credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. The Company had no foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n10. Stockholders\u2019 equity\nPreferred stock\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had authorized 45,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001, of which no shares were issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including dividends and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.\nCommon stock\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had authorized 513,796,572 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001, and 41,203,428 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and is convertible into one share of Class A common stock.\nThe holders of Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. No common stock dividends were declared or paid in 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n11. Stock-based compensation\n2001 stock-based compensation plans\nNonqualified stock option plan\nIn 2001, the Company established the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (\u201cNSO Plan\u201d) under which 1,356,475 stock options with an exercise price of $.000025 remain outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The NSO Plan was terminated in 2003. Stock options under the NSO plan were immediately vested and have a contractual term of 35 years from the date of grant. The outstanding awards will continue to be governed by their existing terms under the NSO Plan. The NSO Plan is accounted for as an equity plan.\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity under the NSO Plan:\nThe total intrinsic value of the NSO Plan stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $78.7 million, $43.1 million and $28.8 million, respectively.\nIncentive and nonqualified stock-based plan\nAlso, in 2001, the Company established the Incentive and Nonqualified Stock-based Plan (\u201cISO Plan\u201d) which was authorized to issue nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options totaling 11,153,872 shares of Class A common stock. This plan was completed in 2020 and no options remained outstanding. The total intrinsic value of the ISO Plan stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $3.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively.\n2012 stock-based compensation plans\nDuring 2012, the Company established the 2012 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (\u201c2012 Plan\u201d) which permits the issuance of 5,200,000 shares of Class A common stock for the grant of nonqualified stock options (\u201cNQSO\u201d) and incentive stock options (\u201cISO\u201d) for management, other employees, and board members of the Company. The options are issued at a price equal to or greater than fair market value at date of grant. All options have a contractual term of 10 years from date of grant.\nThe 2012 Plan is accounted for as an equity plan. For those options expected to vest, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over a four-year period, the total requisite service period of the awards.\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity under the 2012 Plan for the periods indicated as follows:\nThe total intrinsic value of the 2012 Plan stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $17.5 million, $13.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively.\n2017 stock-based compensation plan\nIn 2017, the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2017 Plan\u201d), which was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company\u2019s employees and any parent and subsidiary corporations\u2019 employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares, other cash-based and stock-based awards to the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants and the Company\u2019s parent, subsidiary, and affiliate corporations\u2019 employees and consultants. The 2017 Plan has 14,622,416 authorized shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock reserved for issuance.\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock units, or RSUs, awarded under the 2017 Plan for the period:\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity under the 2017 Plan for the period:\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs was $69.88 and the RSUs generally vest in four equal annual installments. The fair value of RSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2021, was $23.8 million. Total compensation cost related to\nnonvested awards not yet recognized as of December 31, 2021, was $51.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.\nFair value of equity awards\nThe Company measures the fair value of its stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This valuation model requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions, including assumptions related to the expected price volatility of the Company\u2019s stock, the period under which the options will be outstanding, the rate of return on risk-free investments, and the expected dividend yield for the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were estimated using the following assumptions:\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022\nFair Value of Common Stock. The Company used the publicly quoted price as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as the fair value of its common stock.\n\u2022\nExpected Term. The Company used the simplified method to determine the expected term.\n\u2022\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The Company based the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curves with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option.\n\u2022\nExpected Volatility. As the Company does not have an extensive trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility was derived using the historical volatility of the returns of comparable publicly traded companies combined with the brief trading history of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Board of Directors adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) on February 16, 2021, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders and became effective on June 2, 2021. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP is 3,200,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\nThe purchase price for each share of common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of (a) the fair market value per share on the first day of the applicable offering period or (b) the fair market value per share on the applicable purchase date.\nEach offering period will last a number of months determined by the plan administrator, up to a maximum of 27 months. The initial offering period began on July 15, 2021, and ended on January 14, 2022, and new offering periods are expected to begin on each January 15 and July 15 thereafter, unless modified by the plan administrator. The ESPP allows participants to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock through payroll deductions, up to a maximum of 15% of their eligible compensation or $25,000, whichever is lower, and subject to limitations under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan administrator has limited participant contributions to $1,000 per month to prevent prejudicial advantages to higher compensated employees. Participants may withdraw from the ESPP and receive a refund of their accumulated payroll contributions at any time prior to a purchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $4.2 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for a future purchase under the ESPP due to the timing of payroll deductions. There were no purchases related to the ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company recognized $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther\nIn connection with the acquisition of Polliwog in October 2019, per the Stock Purchase Agreement, 256,594 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock will be issued to existing employees, subject to continuing employment. The shares will be issued on the one-, two- and three-year anniversaries of the closing, subject to potential reduction in certain circumstances. The accounting treatment for these shares in the context of the business combination is to recognize the expense as a post-combination expense, not as transaction consideration.\nThe estimated post combination expense to the Company as a result of the Polliwog business combination was approximately $8.7 million which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employment period that was stipulated in the Stock Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining service period is 0.8 years. Once the vesting conditions of the service period are met, the Company will issue shares for each award. Stock-based compensation expense includes $2.9 million, $2.9 million and $0.7 million expense related to these shares for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn connection with the acquisition of World Programming in December 2021, per the Stock Purchase Agreement, $29.5 million of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock will be issued to existing employees, subject to continuing employment and certain other contingencies. The shares will be issued on the one-, two- and three-year anniversaries of the certain legal matters being resolved, subject to potential reduction in certain circumstances. The accounting treatment for these shares in the context of the business combination is to recognize the expense as a post-combination expense, not as transaction consideration.\nThe estimated post combination expense to the Company as a result of the World Programming business combination was approximately $29.5 million which is recognized on an accelerated method over the employment period. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining service period is 3.0 years. Once the vesting conditions of the service period are met, the Company will issue shares for each award. Stock-based compensation expense includes $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nStock-based compensation expense\nThe stock-based compensation expense was recorded as follows (in thousands):\n12. Income taxes\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nThe significant components of the income tax expense are as follows (in thousands):\nThe reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate to income tax expense is as follows (in thousands):\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The impact of GILTI resulted in no incremental tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 due to a full valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. On July 23, 2020, the Department of Treasury published final regulations under the GILTI and Subpart F provisions of the Code regarding the treatment of income that is subject to a high rate of foreign tax (\u201chigh-tax exclusion\u201d). These regulations, among other things, permit U.S. shareholders of foreign corporations to make an election for a controlled foreign corporation to exclude from subpart F income any item of income received by the controlled foreign corporation if that income is subject to an effective tax rate greater than 90% of the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. The Company has evaluated the impact of these regulations and made an election to avail the high-tax exclusion for tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Since this is an annual election, the Company intends to make a high-tax exclusion election for 2021 tax year and has recorded the impact of the election in its 2021 year-end tax provision.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statements purposes. The approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference, and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that give rise to a significant portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nReflects gross amount before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction on a separate or on a consolidated tax filing basis, as applicable, in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the gross deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The Company considers the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n\u2022\ntaxable income in prior carryback years;\n\u2022\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022\nfuture taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; and\n\u2022\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies that the Company would be willing to undertake to prevent a deferred tax asset from otherwise expiring.\nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or whether a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance has occurred also considers all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nnature, frequency, and severity of cumulative losses in recent years;\n\u2022\nduration of statutory carryforward and carryback periods;\n\u2022\nstatutory limitations against utilization of tax attribute carryforwards against taxable income;\n\u2022\nhistorical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and\n\u2022\nnear- and medium-term financial outlook.\nThe weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company uses the actual results for the last two years and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\nThe evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The recognition of deferred tax assets represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of those future events. Changes in the current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain tax jurisdictions, the Company\u2019s analysis indicates that it has cumulative losses in recent years. This is considered significant negative evidence, which is objective and verifiable and, therefore, difficult to overcome. However, the cumulative loss position is not solely determinative and, accordingly, the Company considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based on its analysis, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.\nBased on the evidence available including a lack of sustainable earnings, the Company in its judgment previously recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets in the United States. If a change in judgment regarding this valuation allowance were to occur in the future, the Company will record a potentially material deferred tax benefit, which could result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate in that period.\nThe Company continues to record deferred foreign taxes on gross book-tax basis differences to the extent of foreign distributable reserves and excess cash balances for its subsidiary in India. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to the valuation allowance balance (in thousands):\nThe change in valuation allowance in Other for 2021 of $2.9 million is primarily related to a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets established during purchase accounting from the World Programming acquisition. The change in valuation allowance in Other for 2020 of $7.3 million is primarily related to a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets established during purchase accounting from the Univa acquisition. The change in valuation allowance in Other for 2019 of $11.9 million is related to the issuance of convertible debt, net of issuance costs.\nThe following table summarizes the amount and expiration dates of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $11.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. The Company expects a reduction over the next 12 months in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.2 million which if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate during 2022.\nThe Company operates globally but considers its more significant tax jurisdictions to include the United States, India, Germany, Japan, and China. India has tax years open for examination from 2010 through 2021. All other significant jurisdictions have open tax years from 2016 through 2021.\nThe Company records interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1.0 million, $0.5 million, and $3.4 million, respectively.\n13. Net loss per share\nBasic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, excluding dilutive securities, stock options, RSUs and ESPP shares. Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of dilutive securities, stock options, RSUs and ESPP shares under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted net (loss) income per share amounts (in thousands, except per share data):\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share were as follows (in thousands):\nSince the Company was in a net loss position for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as diluted net loss per share for those periods as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.\nThe Company expects to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash, and therefore, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Conversion Option on diluted net (loss) income per share, if applicable. The Conversion Option will have a dilutive impact on net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the Convertible Notes of $46.50 per share. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's weighted average common stock price was below the conversion price of the Convertible Notes.\n14. Retirement benefits\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) profit sharing plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) for all eligible U.S. employees. This Plan allows eligible employees to contribute up to 80% of their compensation to the Plan. The Company makes discretionary matching contributions to the Plan provided the employee is employed on the last day of the year. Such discretionary contributions vest ratably over five years of service. The Company\u2019s contributions to the Plan were $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company also participates in government-mandated retirement and/or termination indemnity plans, benefiting certain non-U.S. employees. Termination benefits are generally lump sum payments based upon an individual\u2019s years of credited service and annual salary at retirement. These plans are generally unfunded, and employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. The amount of net benefit cost recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for these plans was $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $1.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of benefits paid under these plans was $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation, unlike the projected benefit obligation, does not reflect expected benefit increases from future salary levels, and was $10.0 million and $8.7 million as of December 31, 2021and 2020, respectively, under these plans. The projected benefit obligation, net of plan assets, was $15.7 million and $15.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nA summary of the components of the pension benefits obligation recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):\nThe estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, that are expected to be paid for each of the next five years are as follows (in thousands):\n15. Accumulated other comprehensive loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows (in thousands):\n16. Commitments and contingencies\nWorld Programming\nThe Company acquired World Programming in December 2021. In 2010 SAS Institute, Inc. (\u201cSAS\u201d) filed an action against World Programing in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement to contract, and violations of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA). SAS was unsuccessful on its copyright claims but prevailed on its breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, and UDTPA claims and was awarded damages of $79.1 million in 2016 (the \u201cNC Judgment\u201d). The North Carolina District Court subsequently enjoined World Programming from licensing its WPL software to new customers for use in the United States until the NC Judgment was satisfied. At the time that Altair acquired World Programming, World Programming had partially paid the NC Judgment. On January 3, 2022, the Company paid the outstanding balance of $65.9 million on the NC Judgment. Despite payment in full, SAS has asserted that the Company has not satisfied the Judgment. A hearing to address this issue is scheduled for March 2022.\nIn 2018, SAS filed litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas asserting that World Programming infringed SAS copyrights and patents. SAS voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its patent claims, and the Texas court entered judgment in favor of World Programming on the copyright claims. SAS appealed this judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A decision from the Court of Appeals is pending.\nOther legal proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company has received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend the Company, its partners and its customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish and enforce the Company\u2019s proprietary rights.\nEffects of proceedings\nThe results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nCommitments\nThe Company has entered into various renewable, nonexclusive license agreements under which the Company has been granted access to the licensor\u2019s technology and the right to sell or use the technology in the Company\u2019s products. Royalties are payable to developers of the software at various rates and amounts, which generally are based upon unit sales or revenue. Royalty fees were $10.9 million, $10.4 million, and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reported in Cost of revenue-software.\nAdditionally, the Company has current contractual purchase obligations for services supporting business operations, including non-cancelable agreements. The future purchase obligations for these agreements are as follows (in thousands):\n17. Segment information\nThe Company defines its operating segments as components of its business where separate financial information is available and used by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to its segments and in assessing performance. The Company\u2019s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Company has identified two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Software and Client Engineering Services. The primary measure of segment operating performance is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. Adjusted EBITDA includes an allocation of corporate headquarters costs.\nThe Software reportable segment derives revenue from the sale and lease of software licenses and cloud solutions in the areas of simulation, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence to design and optimize high-performance, efficient, innovative and sustainable products and processes for improved business performance. The Software segment also generates revenue by providing services related to the Company\u2019s software, including consulting, training, and implementation services. To a much lesser extent, the Software segment includes revenue from the sale of hardware products.\nThe Client Engineering Services reportable segment provides support to the Company\u2019s customers with long-term ongoing expertise. The Company hires simulation specialists, industrial designers, design engineers, materials experts, development engineers, manufacturing engineers, data scientists, and information technology specialists for placement at customer sites for specific customer-directed assignments.\nThe \u201cAll other\u201d represents innovative services and products, including toggled \u00ae, the Company\u2019s LED lighting business. toggled\u00ae is focused on developing and selling next-generation solid state lighting technology along with communication and control protocols based, in part, on intellectual property for the direct replacement of fluorescent tubes with LED lighting. Other businesses combined within Other include potential services and product concepts that are still in their development stages and the Company\u2019s WEYV business, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nInter-segment sales are not significant for any period presented. The CODM does not review asset information by segment when assessing performance, therefore no asset information is provided for reportable segments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2-Summary of significant accounting policies.\nThe following tables are in thousands:\n(1)\nIncluded for the year ended December 31, 2021, is $1.2 million currency gains on acquisition-related intercompany loans. Included for the year ended December 31, 2020, are $1.0 million of proceeds from settlements related to a historical acquisition and $0.6 million of severance expense. Included for the year ended December 31, 2019, are acquisition-related costs of $0.6 million, severance expense of $0.4 million, and impairment charges for royalty contracts of $1.0 million.\nRevenue is attributed to geographic areas based on the country of origin. The following table provides sales to external customers and long-lived assets for each of the geographic areas in which the Company operates (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncludes property and equipment, net and definite-lived intangible assets, net.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade receivables. The risk with respect to trade receivables is partially mitigated by the diversity, both by geography and by industry, of the Company\u2019s customer base. The Company\u2019s accounts receivable is derived from sales to a large number of direct customers and resellers around the world. Sales to customers within the automotive industry accounted for approximately 33%, 36%, and 40% of the Company\u2019s 2021, 2020 and 2019 revenue, respectively, with no other industry representing more than 10% of revenue. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019\n18. Subsequent events\nStock repurchase program\nIn February 2022, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock. As permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors, purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices, or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company intends to use the share repurchase plan to opportunistically return capital to shareholders while still focusing on its primary goal of investing in the business to drive growth.\nThe authorization provides that: (1) the new stock repurchase program shall continue until the earlier of the date an aggregate of $50.0 million of common stock has been repurchased , or until suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion; and (2) all shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the new program shall be retired and be available for use and reissuance for purposes as and when determined by the Board of Directors including, without limitation, pursuant to the Company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company\u2019s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit No.\nDescription\nForm\nFile No.\nExhibit\nFiling\nDate\nFiled\nHerewith\n2.1\nAgreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 5, 2018, by and among the
